                    "The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population. It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.\n" +

GS-734 (Remdesivir), a nucleotide analogue pro-drug, originally developed against the Ebola and the Marburg viruses, has been recently suggested to be effective also against coronaviruses. Other potential pharmaceuticals include nucleoside analogues, neuraminidase inhibitors, and RNA synthesis inhibitors.

The transformers’ operating condition in terms of hottest winding temperature, top oil transformer, loss of life (%LOL) are analyzed considering different loads and harmonics content in the transformer currents. Based on these analyses, safe operating conditions of transformer are derived. Six types of consumers having different consumption patterns and different type of residential loads are considered for the analysis. In order to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on loads and distribution transformer, the use of behind-the-meter (BTM) photovoltaic (PV) source, battery energy storage and electric vehicle, load scheduling, less utilization of loads that have distortion factors during office hours are proposed. A performance comparison has been made without and with considering the proposed BTM solution, load scheduling and loads having distortion factors. Simulation results show that, due to lockdown situation of COVID-19 issue, the residential loads consumptions increase during office hours and hence the local distribution transformer gets affected. Also, the proposed BTM solution, load scheduling and less utilization of loads having harmonic distortion can cope up with the increased energy consumptions during office hours.\n" +

Many states in USA have declared emergency and imposed orders to be in partial/fully lockdown conditions. In order to remain safe, people were forced to stay at home, work from home wherever possible and the educational institution, public places were closed in Memphis from March 24th, 2020. Because of people’s staying at home, the energy consumption patterns of residential buildings have changed. Specially, during the office hours, the load consumptions in buildings have increased dramatically. Fig. 2 shows the average load consumptions per half an hour of a house located at Memphis city for the consecutive two months (March and April 2020).

Currently, more than 600,000 cases have been diagnosed and over 25,000 infected people have died [3]. Patients usually present with fever (> 80%), cough (> 60%), and myalgia or fatigue (> 40%) [1,4]. Males are more commonly affected (∼۶۰% of cases) with a median age of approximately 50 years [1,4,5]. The complete spectrum of presentations and complications associated with COVID-19 is not fully elucidated. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic or very mild to severe illness, sepsis and death. While the current state of evidence suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, the study by Guan et al. suggests severe illness occurs in 16% of cases [4,6]. As the pandemic is still in progression, with an incomplete picture and potential treatments in preliminary stages only, we sought to review the available literature relevant to coagulation disorders in patients infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to raise awareness about these potential complications in patients with COVID-19. Thrombotic complications seem to emerge as an important issue in patients with COVID-19. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 pandemic outcomes have shown that infected patients commonly develop thrombocytopenia (36.2%) and may have elevated D-dimer (46.4%) [4], while these rates are even higher in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (57.7% and 59.6%, respectively) [4].

SARS was caused by a novel betacoronavirus that emerged in Guangdong, China in November 2002.9 It resulted in more than 8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries during 2002–۰۳٫۱۰ At that time, SARS hit hard on the neighboring city of Hong Kong which resulted in 1755 confirmed cases including 300 fatal cases11 but no cases were identified in Macau. On the other hand, MERS, caused by a different kind of novel coronavirus, was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 201212 and was responsible for 2499 human infections and 861 fatalities since September 2012.13 When scientific evidence suggested that the virus responsible for the pneumonia-like disease spreading fast across China in December 2019 was closely related to SARS and MERS, any miscommunication could easily spark panic among the general public.\n" +

Epidemiological evidence shows that 2019-nCoV can be transmitted from person to person among close contacts possibly through respiratory droplets. The acute respiratory infection has an incubation period of 2–۱۴ days before any symptoms show. Preliminary data report 11% lethality among hospitalized patients.16 At the time of this manuscript’s authorship, there was no specific medicine or vaccine for coronavirus 2019-nCoV.17,18 According to the cases identified in Macau, the impact of 2019-CoV on human health appears to be mild, and the first patient with the confirmed diagnosis had full recovery and been discharged on February 6, 2020\n"

                            "No organism has a full set of tRNA species for all 61 amino acid-encoded codons.1 Codons without cognate tRNA gene can be referred to as slow codons of the organism. These codons are organism specific codons because different organisms have different tRNA gene compositions. For example, 13 amino acid-encoding codons have no cognate tRNA genes in the human genome. Studies have revealed by ribosomal profiling experiments that translation of codons by rare tRNAs and non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs (by wobble base pairing of codons and tRNAs) reduces translation efficiency2,3, . 4 Moreover, it has been reported that the efficiency of translating a particular codon is affected by the nature of the immediately adjacent codons.5,6 Two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Conversely, coding sequences (CDSs) with low composition of slow codons and slow dicodons may possess fast translation rates. Translation of viral proteins is completely dependent on the translation machinery of host cells. Therefore, the proportions of host-specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral CDSs can be used to predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different viruses of different genera, serotypes, and strains.\n"

This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace. Preliminary studies using molecular modeling and docking, and in that context the potential value of certain known herbal extracts, are also described.\n" +

                            "Coronaviruses are viruses of both medical and veterinary importance [1]. They include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) responsible for the epidemic in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In the past ten years, many new coronaviruses have been identified. They infect a wide range of hosts from mammals to birds and closely related coronaviruses have been identified in distantly related animals suggesting recent interspecies jumps [1]. Like influenza viruses that have similar epidemic properties, they are single stranded RNA viruses with a lipoprotein envelope, and enter the host cells by a Class I fusion protein, i.e. one that does not require any other viral surface proteins for fusion. Viral fusion proteins are potential therapeutic and vaccine targets, and the above is indicative of the possibility that the kind of considerations discussed in the present paper can be extended to broader range of viruses.\n"

Therefore, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view, this investigation examines how organisations have used coopetition to cope with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Key examples include retailers sharing information about stock levels, pharmaceutical organisations working together to develop a vaccine, technological giants collaborating for the greater good, and charities forming alliances for a joint cause. This paper strengthens the extant literature by highlighting the heterogeneity of coopetition strategies that firms can use within a global crisis. Practitioners must balance the risks and rewards of coopetition activities. In turn, they should decide whether to continue to cooperate with their competitors once the pandemic has ended, or resume operating under individualistic business models.

While the health-related shocks associated with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) are well known, the disease has caused commerce to change in unprecedented ways (Cortez & Johnston, 2020). Most employees are working from home (instructed by policy-makers to self-isolate), demand for home deliveries has risen substantially, restaurants and many other establishments have closed their doors to the public, and business failure rates have increased exponentially (Washington Post, 2020). That said however, certain sectors are performing better in comparison to others, such as food and beverage retailers that have served as substitutes for the now-closed bars and restaurants (MSN, 2020). Various recommendations exist for preparing a business for a post-pandemic world, including open innovation and horizon planning (Chesbrough, 2020; Lund Pedersen & Ritter, 2020). For example, Ritter and Lund Pedersen (2020) noted the importance of decision-makers reviewing their business models, focusing on customers, value propositions, value demonstrations, and capabilities, together with the connections between these issues. They add that decision-makers need to define realistic objectives for their organisations, during and after the crisis. In fact, a number of firms (e.g., Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Ford) have changed their business models, through producing aspects of personal protective equipment (as opposed to their normal products) to contribute to the global effort to fight COVID-19 (Fortune, 2020).\n"

                            "On December 31, 2019, the China Health Authority alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to several cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City in Hubei Province in central China. The cases had been reported since December 8, 2019, and many patients worked at or lived around the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market although other early cases had no exposure to this market [1]. On January 7, a novel coronavirus, originally abbreviated as 2019-nCoV by WHO, was identified from the throat swab sample of a patient [2]. This pathogen was later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group [3] and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. As of January 30, 7736 confirmed and 12,167 suspected cases had been reported in China and 82 confirmed cases had been detected in 18 other countries [4]. In the same day, WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [4]. According to the National Health Commission of China,the mortality rate among confirmed cased in China was 2.1% as of February 4 [5] and the mortality rate was 0.2% among cases outside China [6].Among patients admitted to hospitals,the mortality rate ranged between 11% and 15% [7,8]. COVID-19 is moderately infectious with a relatively high mortality rate, but the information available in public reports and published literature is rapidly increasing. The aim of this review is to summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 including causative agent, pathogenesis of the disease, diagnosis and treatment of the cases, as well as control and prevention strategies.\n"

There are four genera within the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, namely Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV), Betacoronavirus (β-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (γ -CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV) [1,2]. The CoV genome is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with a size varying between 26 kb and 32 kb, the largest genome of known RNA viruses. Both α- and β-CoV genera are known to infect mammals, whilst δ- and γ -CoVs infect birds. Two recent outbreaks of viral pneumonia caused by β-CoVs are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2002, an outbreak of SARS was first reported in China and then spread quickly worldwide, resulting in hundreds of deaths with an 11% mortality rate [3,4]. In 2012, MERS first emerged in Saudi Arabia and subsequently spread to other countries, with a fatality rate of 37% [5–۷]. In both of these epidemics, the viruses likely originated from bats and then infected humans through other intermediate animal hosts, e.g. the civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the camel for MERS-CoV [8–۱۰]. Beginning in December 2019, a number of patients with pneumonia of unknown aetiology emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, Central China. Genome sequencing has demonstrated that this pneumonia, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), is caused by a novel CoV, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [11–۱۳].

Corona represents crown-like spikes on the outer surface of the virus; thus, it was named as a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are minute in size (65–۱۲۵ nm in diameter) and contain a single-stranded RNA as a nucleic material, size ranging from 26 to 32kbs in length (Fig. 1). The subgroups of coronaviruses family are alpha (a), beta (b), gamma (c) and delta (d) coronavirus. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), H5N1 influenza A, H1N1 2009 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which leads to pulmonary failure and result in fatality. These viruses were thought to infect only animals until the world witnessed a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV, 2002 in Guangdong, China [1]. Only a decade later, another pathogenic coronavirus, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused an endemic in Middle Eastern countries [2]. ]. Recently at the end of 2019, Wuhan an emerging business hub of China experienced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus that killed more than eighteen hundred and infected over seventy thousand individuals within the first fifty days of the epidemic. This virus was reported to be a member of the b group of coronaviruses. The novel virus was named as Wuhan coronavirus or 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) by the Chinese researchers. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the virus as SARS-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19 [3–۵]. In the history, SRAS-CoV (2003) infected 8098 individuals with mortality rate of 9%, across 26 contries in the world, on the other hand, novel corona virus (2019) infected 120,000 induviduals with mortality rate of 2.9%, across 109 countries, till date of this writing.\n"

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. Aims: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Sources: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. Content: COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2.0e2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7e1.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation. Implications: There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat.\n" +

We must first ensure the safety of our patients and surgical staff. It must be a priority to monitor the availability of supplies for the continued care of patients suffering from COVID-19. As we resume elective orthopedic surgery and total joint arthroplasty, we must begin to reduce expenses by renegotiating vendor contracts, use ambulatory surgery centers and hospital outpatient departments in a safe and effective manner, adhere to strict evidence-based and COVID-19eadjusted practices, and incorporate telemedicine and other technology platforms when feasible for health care systems and orthopedic groups to survive economically. Results: The return to normalcy will be slow and may be different than what we are accustomed to, but we must work together to plan a transition to a more sustainable health care reality which accommodates a COVID-19 world. Conclusion: Our goal should be using these lessons to achieve a healthy and successful 2021 fiscal year.\n" +
                            "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created health care and economic crises at large metropolitan areas throughout the United States, and it is predicted to drive unemployment to a level not seen since the Great Depression. In the United States, fears of the COVID-19 outbreak began as we watched Italy’s health care system grapple with a massive influx of patients. As a result, the U.S. stock market recorded its largest point drop in history on Monday, March 9, 2020 [1]. The World Health Organization designated the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11 [2]. From February 19 to March 19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 35% of its value [3]. California then ordered the first statewide stay-at-home orders for its residents on March 19, 2020 [4]. Similar stay-athome orders and the closure of all nonessential businesses would follow over the next few weeks in 42 states including New York and Massachusetts [5]. The prompt closure of businesses deemed nonessential has forced >16 million Americans to file for unemployment, fueling speculation that the unemployment rate will reach 20% in the second quarter and may reach as high as 30% by the summer of 2020 [6,7]. For comparison, the Great Recession of 2008 reached a peak unemployment rate of 10% [8]. The COVID-19 crisis has created substantial stock market shifts, raised unemployment to a record high, created travel restrictions, and has overwhelmed health care systems throughout the world. The economic implications from the COVID-19 crisis are not like anything we have ever experienced.\n"

                    "Due to the coronavirus global crisis, most countries have put in place restrictive measures in order to confine the pandemia and contain the number of casualties. Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socioeconomic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and online booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41–۱٫۶۷% and job losses may reach the value of 25–۳۰ millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66–۱٫۹۸% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban. We hope that these preliminary results may be of help for informed policy making design of exit strategies from this global crisis.\n" +

                            "The recent COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak and the relevant precautionary measures to limit its spreading are having clear impacts on human mobility at global scale. This provoked a reduction of domestic and international volumes of air passenger traffic to and from China in February (Iacus et al., 2020). Such effects are currently being observed in several regions worldwide. This has clear implications for the aviation industry as well as indirect consequences to several sectors (e.g. tourism) and the economy at large as well as the society. Through the use of historical air traffic data, real time flights tracks and on-line booking systems, this works aims to provide air traffic volume projections following a set of scenarios base on observed and previous crises. These range from a rapid and full recovery to less optimistic scenarios of slower or even incomplete recovery which will depend on the duration and intensity of the lock-down. The trend of mobility at global scale has been rising over the last decade at a pace that is faster than the global world population growth (Recchi et al., 2019). Nevertheless, air traffic flows have been shaped at national and regional scale by shocks due to political instability, terrorism and economic crises (Gabrielli et al., 2019).\n"

                    "Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.\n" +
                            "Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.\n" +
                            "Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–۳۰,۶۹۶ positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\n" +
                            "Conclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.\n"

This outbreak is associated with a large seafood and animal market, and investigations are ongoing to determine the origins of the infection. To date, thousands of human infections have been confirmed in China along with many exported cases across the globe (China CDC, 2020).\n" +
                            "Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and are genetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Li, 2016). The former two genera primarily infect mammals, whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds (Tang et al., 2015). Six kinds of human CoVs have been previously identified. These include HCoV-NL63 and HCoV229E, which belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus; and HCoV-OC43, HCoVHKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which belong to the Betacoronavirus genus (Tang et al., 2015). Coronaviruses did not attract worldwide attention until the 2003 SARS pandemic, followed by the 2012 MERS and, most recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreaks (China CDC, 2020; Song et al., 2019). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are considered highly pathogenic (Cui et al., 2019), and it is very likely that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from bats to palm civets (Guan et al., 2003) or dromedary camels (Drosten et al., 2014), and finally to humans (Cui et al., 2019).\n" +
                            "The genome of coronaviruses, whose size ranges between approximately 26,000 and 32,000 bases, includes a variable number (from 6 to 11) of open reading frames (ORFs) (Song et al., 2019). The first ORF representing approximately 67% of the entire genome encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), while the remaining ORFs encode accessory proteins and structural proteins (Cui et al., 2019). The four major structural proteins are the spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). The spike surface glycoprotein plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell and determines host tropism (Li, 2016; Zhu et al., 2018). The spike proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV bind to different host receptors via different receptor-binding domains (RBDs). SARSCoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as one of the main receptors (Ge et al., 2013) with CD209L as an alternative receptor (Jeffers et al., 2004), whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the primary receptor. Initial analysis suggested that 2019-nCoV has a close evolutionary association with the SARSlike bat coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020). Here, based on the first three determined genomes of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), namely Wuhan/ IVDC-HB-01/2019 (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_402119) (HB01), Wuhan/IVDCHB-04/2019 (EPI_ISL_402120) (HB04), and Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019 (EPI_ ISL_402121) (HB05), an in-depth genome annotation of this virus was performed with a comparison to related coronaviruses, including 1,008 human SARSCoV, 338 bat SARS-like CoV, and 3,131 human MERS-CoV, whose genomes were published before January 12, 2020 (release date: September 12, 2019) from Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (http://www.viprbrc. org/) and NCBI.\n"

This poses a challenge to maintain appropriate patient care while preventing a significant backlog of patients once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. In practices that are naive to telehealth as an alternative option, providers and staff are experiencing challenges with telemedicine implementation. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to rapidly integrate telemedicine into practice during a pandemic. Methods: We built a toolkit that details 8 essential components to successful implementation of a telemedicine platform: Provider and staff training, patient education, an existing electronic medical record system, patient and provider investment in hardware, billing and coding integration, information technology support, audiovisual platforms, and patient and caregiver participation. Results: Rapid integration of telemedicine in our practice was required to be compliant with our institution’s COVID-19 Taskforce. Within 3 days of this declaration, our large specialty-care clinic converted to a telemedicine platform and we completed 638 visits within the first month of implementation. Conclusions: Effective and efficient integration of a telemedicine program requires extensive staff and patient education, accessory platforms to facilitate video and audio communication, and adoption of new billing codes that are outlined in this toolkit.\n" +

In addition to reducing the potential risk of infectious disease transmission, telemedicine visits have achieved similar health outcomes compared with in-person patient visits in several primary care studies6 , and have ancillary benefits of reducing travel costs and time away from work 7 . Subspecialists across multiple disciplines have also used telemedicine to increase access for patients seen in rural clinics. This has been associated with high levels of satisfaction among both patients and their primary care physicians7 . In a study from the Veterans Administration, patients seeking care from the Greater Los Angeles area rated their satisfaction as “very good” to “excellent” in 95% of cases8 .

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified a novel beta-coronavirus called 2019- nCoV, now officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020), that was responsible for the pandemic. This was the third zoonotic coronavirus breakout in the first two decades of the 21st century, allowing human-to-human transmission and raising global health concerns. The Chinese government had taken immediate, transparent and extraordinary measures, and reached initial achievements to control the outbreak. As of 11 March 2020, the pandemic caused an accumulation of 80955 confirmed cases and 3162 deaths in China, and 37364 confirmed cases and 1130 deaths in 113 other countries worldwide. World Health Organization (WHO) is deeply concerned by the unprecedented swift global spread and severity of the outbreak, and by the ignorance and inaction of some countries. Therefore, WHO announced that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic (WHO, 2020). The biological features of 2019-nCoV and experiences combating COVID-19 should be updated in time and need to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. What’s more, 2019-nCoV demonstrated partial resemblance with SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, in phylogenetic analysis, clinical manifestations and pathological findings.

This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated—Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation—public health experts, the government, and the general public. It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation.

                    "Coronavirus disease 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic virus causing a variety of severe respiratory diseases. SARS-CoV-2 is closest to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in structure. The high prevalence of COVID-19 is a result of a lack of symptoms at onset. Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment and prevention. Whole genome sequences and some viral proteins were investigated to determine gaps and changes in alternation of nucleotides and amino acid sequences. We evaluate 11 complete genome sequences of different coronaviruses using BAST and MAFFT software. We also selected seven types of structural proteins. We conclude that COVID-19 might produce new mutations, specifically in glycoproteins, so caution and complete preparation by health authorities is required.\n" +

                            "Novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) first emerged on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan city, China. COVID-19 is classified as the seventh member of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae under the family Coronaviridae. Most members of this family are zoonotic viruses transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals. Although bats and snakes are the natural reservoir of most coronaviruses, there is no evidence so far that COVID-19 originated in or was transmitted from a seafood market [1]. Comparison of the lipid rafts of coronaviruses has indicated that the new strain COVID-19 has 80% identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Lipid molecules such as caveolins, clathrins and dynamin have a fundamental role in the internalization of viruses. These molecules are involved in the entry of viruses into host cells, and targeting host lipids is being studied as an antiviral strategy and could have various applications [2]. COVID-19 seems to need to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor on the membrane host cell to enable it to infect the host cell upon coupled with a reliance of serine protease TMPRSS2. This intracellular protein seems to be a determinant of the virus ability to infect the cell [3].\n"

                            "Novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia, which was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO on the February 11, 2020, has rapidly increased in epidemic scale since it first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1]. On the same day, the international virus classification commission announced that the novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is not the first severe respiratory disease outbreak caused by the coronavirus. Just in the past two decades, coronaviruses have caused three epidemic diseases, namely, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2]. At present, the cases of COVID-19 have been found in many countries around the world [3]. According to the latest data, up to the March 1, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in China reached 79,968, of which 2,873 were dead, and 41,681 were cured. In addition to China, the number of confirmed cases in other countries also reached 7,041, of which 105 were dead, and 459 were cured. On the 31st of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was listed as the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), meaning that it may pose risks to multiple countries and requires a coordinated international response. The review tries to explain the molecular immune pathogenesis and diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide a reference for the prevention and drug development of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the recent research progress of SARS-CoV-2 and the knowledge from researches on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n"

                    "Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a publichealth emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.\n" +
                            "Introduction\n" +
                            "Chloroquine is an amine acidotropic form of quinine that was synthesised in Germany by Bayer in 1934 and emerged approximately 70 years ago as an effective substitute for natural quinine [1,2]. Quinine is a compound found in the bark of Cinchona trees native to Peru and was the previous drug of choice against malaria [3]. For decades, chloroquine was a front-line drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide [4]. Chloroquine and the 4-aminoquinoline drug hydroxychloroquine belong to the same molecular family. Hydroxychloroquine differs from chloroquine by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain: the N-ethyl substituent is βhydroxylated. This molecule is available for oral administration in the form of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Hydroxychloroquine has pharmacokinetics similar to that of chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption and renal elimination. However, the clinical indications and toxic doses of these drugs slightly differ. In malaria, the indication for chloroquine was a high dose for a short period of time (due to its toxicity at high doses) or a low dose for a long period of time. Hydroxychloroquine was reported to be as active as chloroquine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria and less toxic, but it is much less active than chloroquine against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum owing to its physicochemical properties. What is advantageous with hydroxychloroquine is that it can be used in high doses for long periods with very good tolerance. Unfortunately, the efficacy of chloroquine gradually declined due to the continuous emergence of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains [5]. Chloroquine is also utilised in the treatment of autoimmune diseases [6]. Yet the activity of the molecule is not limited to malaria and the control of inflammatory processes, as illustrated by its broad-spectrum activity against a range of bacterial, fungal and viral infections [7–۱۰].\n"

                    "https://e-tarjome.com/storage/panel/fileuploads/2020-02-26/1582723770_E14556-e-tarjome.pdf",
                    "Background Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n" +
                            "Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–۲۴, ۲۰۲۰٫ We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n" +
                            "Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·۶۸ (۹۵% CrI 2·۴۷–۲·۸۶) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304–۱۳۰ ۳۳۰) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·۴ days (95% CrI 5·۸–۷·۱). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–۸۰۵), ۱۱۳ (۵۷–۱۹۳), ۹۸ (۴۹–۱۶۸), ۱۱۱ (۵۶–۱۹۱), and 80 (40–۱۳۹) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–۲ weeks.\n" +
                            "Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally\n"

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS or COVID-19 and pregnancy. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were hospitalized pregnant women with a confirmed coronavirus relatedeillness, defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, preeclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. RESULTS: Nineteen studies including 79 hospitalized women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 26 (32.9%) by severe acute respiratory syndrome. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8%, and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%), and dyspnea (27.0%). For all coronavirus infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% confidence interval, 20.2e59.8); the rate of preterm birth <37 weeks was 24.3% (95% confidence interval, 12.5e38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% confidence interval, 9.5e34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% confidence interval, 4.2e34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% confidence interval, 3.2e24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% confidence interval, 84.8e19.6), and 57.2% of newborns (95% confidence interval, 3.6e99.8) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth <37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% of cases (95% confidence interval, 25.6e57.6), while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% confidence interval, 1.4e16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, preterm birth is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. COVID-19 infection was associated with a relatively higher rate of preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death."

A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials before the end of the year.\n" +

Since this time, the virus has rapidly spread across mainland China, and now has reached other countries (Li et al., 2020a; Chen et al., 2020a). In the early stages of this virus spread, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported. Patients have been diagnosed with severe acute respiratory infection symptoms and others with rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure and other serious complications leading to death (Nijuan et al., 2013). The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified this infection as a novel coronavirus infection on Jan 7, 2020 and on Feb 11, 2020, the WHO announced a new name for the epidemic disease as 2019-new coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV and now known as COVID19) (Organization, W.H., 2020). Additionally, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has become a major global health concern and the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic on March 2020 (Whitworth, 2020).

The virus has been recently named the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease has been called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).2 So far, there is uncertainty regarding the transmission capacity of the virus. Recent studies show the presence of a high viral load in the oropharynx at early stages of the disease, which increases the concern about the high risk of infectivity during incubation periods or with only mild symptoms.3 The average incubation period has been estimated to be 5–۶ days, with a range of 1–۱۴ days. In over 80% of cases the symptoms ofthe disease are mild (fever, cough, expectoration, general malaise), while approximately 20% may have serious clinical manifestations (pneumonia and other clinical complications) that require hospital admission.

Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS. In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, “conventional drug in new use” becomes a feasible solution. The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the “specific drug”.

Since December 2019, it has spread rapidly in China in a short period of time. As of March 17, 2020, there have been 81116 confirmed cases and 3231 deaths. It has also outbreak in other countries, such as Korea, Japan, Italy, Singapore, and Iran, with a total of 85296 cases confirmed. Due to it is a newlyemerged virus, researchers have taken quick actions to isolate the virus and perform gene sequencing, making identifying treatments possible. Even so, it takes time to develop new drugs and vaccines, as well as to explore biotherapeutics, thus it is unlikely to be applied to patients with urgent need. Therefore, “conventional drug in new use” becomes a viable solution. The SARS-CoV-2 is 80% homologous with the acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which also broke out in China in 2002, and some enzymes are even more than 90% homologous [1]. Consequently, we are expecting to find drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 from the experience of SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Some drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir, and corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS [2], within the selection range of “conventional drug in new use”. Through clinical treatment of the COVID-19, it has been found that neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir), ganciclovir, acyclovir, ribavirin are ineffectual and not recommended for clinical application [3].\n"

                            "An outbreak of pneumonia with unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan of Hubei Province, China on December in 2019. Chinese scientists confirmed that a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of pneumonia outbreak. Now, this severe acute respiratory syndrome has been termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health of Organization (WHO) [1]. Coronavirus is a group of viruses categorized into alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus often causing cold and other mild upper respiratory tract infections in the human body. Alphacoronavirus consists of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63; Betacoronavirus consists of HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Nevertheless, the rare form would be lethal such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19 [2]. SRAS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are betacoronavirus [3]. However, SARSr-CoVs belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously lineage B) of genus Betacoronavirus and occupy a unique phylogenetic position. It’s the most lethal [4]. On the 20th of March 2020, 178 countries or territories reported that there are 234073 in the total confirmed case with 9840 deaths globally; 81300 confirmed cases and 3253 deaths reported in China [5]; 257 confirmed case with 4 deaths in Hong Kong [6]. In response to the outbreak, we summarize the current knowledge of COVID-19 and compare it with the previous experiences of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong to study for an effective measurement to control the COVID-19 epidemic.\n"

As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24–۳٫۵۸٫ Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.\n" +

So far, 2019-nCoV has affected more than 43 000 patients in 28 countries/regions and has became a major global health concern (https: //www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/ 20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9_4). On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-nCoV: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Regarding the virus itself, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the previously provisionally named 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. Although early studies reported a link between a single local fish and wild animal market and most cases of infection, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission, studies have increasingly demonstrated human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through droplets or direct contact [2,8–۱۰]. Moreover, according to one study, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41% of patients [8]. Based on the evidence of a rapidly increasing incidence of infections [11] and the possibility of transmission by asymptomatic carriers [12], SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted effectively among humans and exhibits high potential for a pandemic [5,10,13].\n"

Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds.

Swift actions were taken by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Chinese health authorities, and researchers. The World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named this pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [2]. On January 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was released, which helped researchers to quickly identify the virus in patients using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods [3]. On January 21, the first article related to 2019-nCoV was published, which revealed that 2019-nCoV belongs to the beta-coronavirus group, sharing ancestry with bat coronavirus HKU9-1, similar to SARS-coronaviruses, and despite sequence diversity its spike protein interacts strongly with the human ACE2 receptor [1]. On January 30, the WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Later, the human-to-human transmission was confirmed. As of January 31, 51 whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from different laboratories and regions have been submitted to GISAID database [4]. On the February 12 th , the WHO permanently named the 2019-nCoV pathogen as SARS-CoV-2 and the causing disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Chinese government swift actions helped them to control COVID-19 in China. However, SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread to over 150 countries. On March 11th , WHO formally recognized the COVID-19 as a pandemic. By March 19th , 2020, the global death toll reached to 9,913, with 2,42,650 laboratory-confirmed cases. The case fatality rate among infected people is varying in different countries. However, global case fatality rate is presently around 3.92% (calculated as deaths / [deaths + laboratory confirmed cases]).\n"

We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.\n" +

                            "A mysterious pneumonia illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread to a dozen of countries including the United States with thousands of infected individuals and hundreds of deaths within a month [1]. Scientists in China have isolated the virus from patients and determined its genetic code. The pathogen responsible for this epidemic is a new coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization. 2019-nCoV belongs to the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years.\n" +
                            "Coronaviruses consist of a large diverse family of viruses. They can be classified into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta coronavirus [2,3]. Representative alphacoronaviruses include human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), while the betacoronaviruses include the best-known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Based on nucleic acid sequence similarity, the newly identified 2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus. The entry of all coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by spike glycoprotein that gives coronaviruses a crownlike appearance by forming spikes on their surface. The amino acid sequence of spike glycoprotein consists of a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor, and a short C-terminal intracellular tail [3]. The ectodomain contains a receptor-binding unit S1 and a membrane-fusion unit S2. Electron microscopic imaging illustrated that spike glycoprotein forms a clove-shaped spike with three S1 heads and a trimeric S2 stalk. For a virus to enter a host cell, S1 binds to a specific cell surface receptor via its receptorbinding domain (RBD), and S2 fuses the host cell and viral membranes, enabling the entry of viral genomes into host cells. Specific RBD-receptor binding determines if a cell or animal can be infected and also serves as a target for therapeutic inventions to treat diseases caused by coronaviruses. Previous studies have identified angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [4,5]. In this study, we analyzed the structure of spike glycoprotein RBD of 2019-nCoV and identified a unique feature that potentially allows a high affinity binding to ACE2 in human cells. We further discussed potential candidates for natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, routes of transmission, and strategies to inhibit virus entry for therapeutic applications.\n"

Initially, most of the confirmed cases were linked with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, where numerous types of live wild animals are sold, including poultry, bats, groundhogs, and snakes. To identify the causative agent of this disease, a large number of tests were conducted, which ruled out several etiological agents that may cause similar symptoms, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), avian influenza virus, and other common respiratory pathogens. Finally, a new coronavirus, putatively named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020, was identified as the causative pathogen of this outbreak. On January 20, after a visit to Wuhan, Professor Zhong Nanshan, a SARS intervention specialist, confirmed that 2019-nCoV was spreading between people [1], which led to increased vigilance by the Chinese government and people. At 10:00 on January 23, Wuhan, the birthplace of the disease, declared a general closure to prevent its further spread. However, Wuhan is a major transportation hub located in the central region of the People‟s Republic of China with approximately 11 million inhabitants [2], and the period from the end of December 2019 to February 2020 was the time of the “Spring Festival travel rush”. Although the Chinese government made great efforts to control the flow of people, the disease spread rapidly from Wuhan to other cities, as well as other countries, likely through asymptomatic carriers [3].\n"

WHO has declared the pandemic outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a global health emergency. Immunotherapy is an efficient therapeutic option intervention against viral infections. Most immunotherapy attempts have been successful to fight against similar COVID-19 viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The main methods in this regard include several vaccines and monoclonal antibody candidates. Furthermore, according to existing evidence in fighting against viral infections such as Ebola, influenza, SARS, and MERS plasma exchange can likely reduce the viral load and disease mortality [3,4]. In both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses entry into the host cells is mediated by interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein on virus outer-membrane and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cell. So, these proteins can be the major potential targets for immunotherapy [1,5]. The increasing knowledge of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV immunotherapies in recent years might increase the opportunities to design effective same therapeutics for novel coronavirus [3].\n"

Real ventilators require considerable testing for reliability. They have to monitor patients and set off alarms if too much or too little air is going to the lungs. They have sophisticated algorithms to regulate flow depending on how well the patient is inhaling. Even if Standard Transmission did create something usable, Sawkar says, it would never be able to manufacture enough units to interest the city.

Most countries lacked adequate hospital capacity, ICU units, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In the UK, for example, early estimates suggested that the NHS would be short of 20,000 ventilators (Davies & Rankin, 2020). In response, several governments called on private-sector firms to help produce PPE and ventilators.1 Many organisations, including LVMH, Airbus, Dyson, GM, and Ford, offered to deploy their resources, some individually and others jointly, to produce the needed items, including hand sanitiser, face shields or simple fabric face masks, medical-grade face masks,2 and ventilators. These efforts were supported by individuals and organisations sharing relevant information, designs, and design blueprints (Chesbrough, 2020; Crick & Crick, 2020) and by relaxing some requirements and rules about producing these goods. Many attempts at being resourceful- through deploying resources in activities beyond their current use- were, however, unsuccessful or deficient: some products were of unacceptable quality, could not be produced at scale, had limited clinical effectiveness (e.g., only short emergency use), or failed to secure regulatory clearance.3 It is crucial that we understand why some initiatives succeeded while others failed.\n"

The virus is fundamentally identified with terror as a menacing force that wipes out existing regimes of signification due to its uncertain motives, origins, and operational mode. In this context, familiar urban spaces, cultural practices, and intersubjective communications are redefined, repurposed, and reprogrammed. This process is called terrorealization, as the desertification and metaphorical sublation of all prior territorial significations. This study contributes to the narrative sub-stream of place branding by approaching a globally relevant socio-cultural phenomenon from a brand storytelling perspective.\n" +

                            "Lethal viruses are responsible for a long trail and an even longer bodycount in the history of mankind. The Bubonic plague (also known as Black Death) that lasted between AD 1346–۱۳۵۳ wiped out 200 million of the human population, while the influenza pandemic that spread at the turn of the last century reached a death toll of 50 million (MpHOnline, 2018). In a more contemporary setting, viruses such as Ebola and SARS, although less deadly than their predecessors in absolute numbers, still managed to decimate a significant portion of those who were infected. The new Corona virus, named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO), which broke towards the end of 2019 in the Chinese region of Wuhan, reached epidemic status within a month before being elevated to a pandemic within two months (Escalas, 2004).\n" +
                            "The impact of the virus on consumer sentiment became increasingly palpable as the death toll rose in the course of its globalization, resulting in panic buying and empty retail shelves for certain products. This sentiment was reflected in deep-seated anxieties (Holt, 2005, 2012) that emerged in the face of the virus, from a cultural branding point of view. These anxieties tend to ramify towards multiple directions, only indirectly related to the virus as such, ranging from disgruntlement with governmental structures to toilet-paper out-of-stock incidents. The historical juncture at which this study was undertaken, that is, two months from the virus’ outbreak, is of particular importance for genealogical reasons, as it encapsulates a socio-cultural phenomenon at the time of its emergence. Subsequently, the narrative account offered in this paper could be applied in later phases of the brand story’s evolution in what is very likely, based on official reports, to constitute a pandemic of proportions that parallel the influenza that spread at the turn of last century, at least in terms of the number infected, if not of the number deceased.\n" +
                            "Covid-19 is approached in this paper from a brand storytelling point of view (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010; Fog, Budtz, & Yakaboylu, 2005; Hopkinson & Hogarth-Scott, 2001; Patterson & Brown, 2005; Ruiz–Collantes & Oliva, 2015), as an anthropomorphic entity (Brown, 2010; Miles & Ibrahim, 2013; Rossolatos, 2013), with its own brand values, imagery, and trajectory of becoming. This trajectory is mapped with the aid of narratology and metaphorical modeling (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 2003). Metaphorical modeling is not a fanciful add-on to a narrative model, but a way of demonstrating the inherently tropic articulation of a narrative text.\n"

Smart and precision farming allows farmers to be more informed and productive. The advent of 5G will considerably change the nature of jobs in farming and agriculture. The internet of things (IoT)-based cloud computing service in the 5G network provides flexible and efficient solutions for smart farming. This will allow the automated operation of various unmanned agricultural machines for the plowing, planting, and management phases of crop farming and will ultimately achieve secure, reliable, environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient operations and enable unmanned farms. This paper provides a complete survey on 5G technology in the agricultural sector and discusses the need for and role of smart and precision farming; benefits of 5G; applications of 5G in precision farming such as real-time monitoring, virtual consultation and predictive maintenance, data analytics and cloud repositories; and future prospects.\n" +

                            "Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood and plays a vital role in most countries’ economies. Agriculture is not only associated with crop production but also includes animal breeding and land cultivation to offer food, fiber, and medicine. Different types of agriculture are practiced in different regions across the world, focusing primarily on providing healthy food to feed the population worldwide. Agriculture is the main source of income for developing countries. It ensures food security for a country and produces material for industry. Modern farming started approximately in the 18th century, referred to as the British Agricultural Revolution, when in a short period, many improvements were made to farming, leading to a major yield increase and more efficient methods. A four-field system and selective cross-breeding program were implemented to increase crop size as well as yields, replacing the three-field crop rotation system. The first subsequent revolution in agriculture took place between 1900 and the 1930s, when mechanized agriculture allowed each farmer to produce enough for 26 people. This agricultural revolution brought techniques such as soil management and the advent of various new farming tools. After many decades, a second revolution, known as the Green Revolution, took place in the 1990s. Genetically modified crops that are pest resistant and need less water were introduced with the help of scientific advancements, allowing each farmer to feed 155 people. The second revolution promoted the use of mechanized tools in farming practices, increasing the rate of production as well as the quantity of crop yield. The third revolution, also described as a green revolution, was the phase when genetically modified crops began to be used by almost everyone, leading to greater produce output.\n"

This study uses a qualitative scenario method to propose four possible futures for tourism academia considering the pandemic and to draw attention to key factors of these future developments. Nine interviews were held with tourism (full/ordinary) professors across Europe, America, Asia, and the Pacific Region to gain expert insights. As a result, four scenarios are proposed for tourism education, industry collaboration, research, and discipline identity. Recovery (“new sustainability” or “revenge-tourism”) for tourism academia if the pandemic impact is short-term, and Adaptancy (“bridging the gap” or “decline”) for tourism academia if the COVID-19 impact is long-lasting. Key factors for the way forward are finally discussed and contributions of our findings are highlighted.\n" +
                            "۱٫ Introduction\n" +
                            "Although the precise beginning of “tourism academia” is difficult to trace, it is generally assumed that related research has undergone more than 40 years (Airey, 2015). Butler (2015) pointed out that it is a common misperception that the subject is of recent origin and just materialised after the advent of mass tourism, while contemporary travel has many common features with tourism even two millennia ago. Travel literature itself indeed has a millennial history with early evidence of travel writing by Ancient Greeks and Romans.\n" +
                            "By most defined as a multi-disciplinary field rather than as a discipline, interest in tourism academia has had steady growth, and numbers of journals have increased significantly. However, the field has long been criticized for the limited capacity to solve real-world problems (Buckley, 2012; Butler, 2015; Walters, Burns, & Stettler, 2015) and for a subordinate role in interdisciplinary collaborations (McKercher & Prideaux, 2014; Okumus, van Niekerk, Koseoglu, & Bilgihan, 2018).\n" +
                            "Contemporary tourism academia finds its roots in early descriptive and rather advocative studies of the tourism phenomenon (Butler, 2015; Jafari, 1990, Jafari, 2001, Jafari, 2007), while a more cautionary and critical turn was initiated partly by intense theory development in the 1970s; largely as a response to real-world and/or industry issues. Regarding contemporary tourism academia, a complex picture of a globally expanding multi-disciplinary field emerges; arguably in a sort of identity crisis and with low (perceived) relevance for the industry and other scientific fields.\n"

                            "COVID-19 has brought the impact of cigarette smoking on health to even greater public awareness. Concerns about respiratory health have motivated many attempts to quit smoking (Elling et al., 2020; Grogan et al., 2020; Klemperer et al., 2020) and the role of cigarette smoking in COVID-19 severity continues to be debated (J et al., 2020; van Zyl-Smit et al., 2020). However, societal responses to the pandemic and changes in healthcare access (e.g., loss of insurance coverage, fewer office visits, overburdened providers) compound existing barriers to smoking cessation treatment.\n" +
                            "In considering these difficulties, the social ecological model (McLeroy et al., 1988) is a useful framework. At the individual level, people are experiencing greater stress and boredom during the pandemic, which are key triggers for smoking (American Psychiatric Association, 2020; Grogan et al., 2020). Individuals attempting smoking cessation describe numerous potential obstacles, including lack of access to previous coping strategies (e.g., going to the gym, visiting family and friends) (Rosoff-Verbit et al., 2021). At the interpersonal/relational level, conflict at home and living with other smokers contributes to continued smoking (Meacham et al., 2013). At the community/organizational level, people may have less access to school- and workplace-based smoking cessation programs. Moreover, loss of employment in the United States usually results in lost access to health insurance (Panchal et al., 2020). At the policy level, public health departments face budget shortfalls, potentially scaling back smoking cessation resources. These challenges are likely to negatively impact the use of evidence-based smoking cessation treatments during the pandemic, including behavioral counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and prescription medications.\n"

We suggest that the conceptual separation between nature and society renders accounting for the circular economy and the COVID-19 pandemic problematic. A critical account of the circular economy might problematize things like the whole economic system’s physical scale, spatial and temporal system boundaries, consumer culture, and the inherent politics of the circular economy. We also suggest that a critical account of the COVID-19 pandemic needs to take on board the participation of accounting representations in the construction of particular narratives about the virus. In particular, calculations of the costs caused by COVID-19 need to be connected to the ecological value of viruses to illustrate how the social and the biological worlds are inextricably connected. In both cases, we suggest critical accounting researchers need to be actively involved in discussions about how valuation constructs narratives about resource or waste, with significant implications on how we conceive the relationship between humanity and the environment.\n" +

According to the estimates of the Global Footprint Network, humanity and the global economic systems are consuming 60% above what the planet’s ecosystems can reproduce (https://www.footprintnetwork.org/). Humanity is transgressing several planetary boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009), and the ecological overshoot is producing, according to stratigraphers, not only ecological but also geological changes, giving rise to the Anthropocene (Davies, 2016).\n" +
                            "At the same time, an increasing number of international initiatives pursuing sustainability are assigning key roles to accounting. Disclosure appears in a central position in European Union sustainability strategies (at the time of writing, the EU is reforming Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial reporting), in the EU strategies on due diligence in supply chains (e.g., regulation 2017/821), as well as in the UK Modern Slavery Act or the French Corporate Duty of Vigilance Law (Folke et al., 2019). Likewise, multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as the United Nations Global Compact or the Seafood Business for Ocean Stewardship, attribute significant roles to accounting (Bebbington et al., 2020a). This evidence points towards a central functionality of accounting in attempts to address ecological challenges (Bebbington and Larrinaga, 2014, Bebbington et al., 2020a).\n" +

There is a burgeoning literature exploring the accounting implications of the environmental crisis (Bebbington and Larrinaga, 2014, Bebbington et al., 2020a, Bebbington et al., 2017). However, compared with our knowledge of how corporations disclose sustainability reports to negotiate perceptions about societal environmental demands (e.g., Cho et al., 2012, Cho et al., 2015), we know very little about the interplay between accounting and substantial attempts to address ecological challenges.\n"

In addition, these facilities are attended by users to relax, socialize, and to function as a place for inhabiting competitions and championships, whenever needed. Moreover, the health club environments operate to be dynamic and motivational, for individuals who are willing to improve and maintain their physical appearances.

                    "Emergency management (EM) professionals play an integral role in preparing healthcare organizations for disasters but evidence of their pervasiveness in Canadian healthcare is limited. Through an exploratory Canada-wide survey of EM in healthcare organizations, we aim to develop understanding of the prevalence and effectiveness of the disaster preparedness activities enacted in preparation for COVID-19. The online survey generated 161 responses; 150 (93%) had EM responsibility. EM reported that reviewing infectious disease (pandemic) plans and protocols was the most widespread activity (82%), while simulation-based exercises was the least (26%). Organizational incident management response to COVID-19 was led by a sole ‘incident commander’ ۶۱% of the time, while 39% of ‘incident commands’ were led by multiple individuals. Of all those assigned to lead IM, only 68% received training in that role. Overall, the prevalence of disaster preparedness activities in healthcare organizations was positively associated with leaders who received training in incident response and having a dedicated EM resource. Meanwhile, the overall effectiveness of activities was positively correlated with having a sole ‘incident commander’ and was found to improve as the overall prevalence of activities rose. The study provides strong evidence for regional, organizational, and EM resource variation in the delivery of disaster preparedness activities and training for leaders in Canadian healthcare. Hence, we recommend the creation of a national health emergency preparedness system which includes legislated standards and a national training centre to ensure Canadian healthcare is bolstered against future disasters including pandemics.\n" +

                            "۱Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 [1] and as of April 2021, has infected over 132 million and claimed more than 2 million lives [2]. As of May 2021 Canada has 1,305,770 cases with 64,802 hospitalizations and 24,766 deaths [3]. Prior to the COVID pandemic the Canadian Health System was already under immense pressure to provide equitable access to coordinated care, notably specialist and elective surgical services [4]. As news coming out of China became more difficult to ignore and cases were detected internationally in early 2020, public health entities and epidemiological experts within Canada started sounding the alarm. In healthcare organizations preparedness activities intensified as cases appeared in the Toronto area.\n" +
                            "Evidence soon showed widespread community transmission within most Canadian provinces. As a result, efforts related to planning and preparedness quickly shifted to response with case counts rising rapidly. By March 22nd all Canadian provinces and territories had declared states of emergency [5]. Provincial health systems struggled to provide consistent guidance to health providers and services were constricted to focus efforts on building capacity for anticipated COVID-19 patients. Canada’s ability to mount a coordinated and standardized response to national health crisis suffers from untested emergency management plans and struggles over jurisdictional issues [6,7]. As a result, many healthcare organizations in Canada remain chronically un-prepared for potential disasters, including global pandemics [8]. While evidence for the impact of COVID-19 on hospital services and operations, including switching to virtual care delivery models, are beginning to emerge [9], what remains unclear is just how effective, and wide-spread, were emergency preparedness activities undertaken by healthcare organizations in the response to COVID-19.\n"

                            "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) can occur in COVID-19 and has impact on clinical course. Data on CVD prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and sequelae in survivors is limited. Aim of this prospective study carried out on consecutive unselected COVID-19 population, was to assess: 1) CVD occurrence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2) persistence or new onset of CVD at one-month and one-year follow-up.\n" +
                            "Methods:\n" +
                            "Over 30 days n = 152 COVID-19 patients underwent cardiovascular evaluation. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG), Troponin and echocardiography were integrated by further tests when indicated. Medical history, arterial blood gas, blood tests, chest computed tomography and treatment were recorded. CVD was defined as the occurrence of a new condition during the hospitalization for COVID-19. Survivors attended a one-month follow-up visit and a one-year telephone follow-up.\n" +
                            "Results:\n" +
                            "Forty-two patients (28%) experienced a wide spectrum of CVD with acute myocarditis being the most frequent. Death occurred in 32 patients (21%) and more frequently in patients who developed CVD (p = 0.032). After adjustment for confounders, CVD was independently associated with death occurrence. At one-month follow-up visit, 7 patients (9%) presented persistent or delayed CVD. At one-year telephone follow-up, 57 patients (48%) reported persistent symptoms.\n" +
                            "Conclusion:\n" +
                            "Cardiovascular evaluation in COVID-19 patients is crucial since the occurrence of CVD in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common (28%), requires specific treatment and increases the risk of in-hospital mortality.\n" +

                            "The outbreak of COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly characterized by a pulmonary involvement. However, cardiovascular complications can occur. During the first wave of the pandemic early observations reported an increased level of Troponin in a proportion of patients (10–۱۲%) (۱,۲) associated with increased mortality (3). An increasing number of sporadic cases reporting cardiovascular involvement has been described afterwards, including Tako-Tsubo syndrome (4), ST-segment elevation (5) and other cases generally reported as myocarditis or myopericarditis (6,7).\n" +
                            "Considering this growing evidence, studies based on echocardiographic evaluation were carried out which reported a high prevalence of cardiac involvement (8,9). However, these evaluations were limited to echocardiography without further cardiac examinations in case of positive findings.\n" +
                            "The wide spectrum of cardiovascular complication can be related to the release of cytokines mediated by SARS-CoV-2, possibly causing myocardial inflammation in addition to vascular inflammation and plaque instability. Direct myocardial damage by the virus should also be considered despite the fact that undisputable localization of SARS-CoV-2 within cardiomyocytes has been not proven among the limited number of autopsies in COVID-19 (10–۱۴). The presence of cardiovascular risk factors or cardiac disease, both pre-existing and new, is related to poor prognosis (15–۱۸). Despite the detection of the new CVD appears of paramount importance for in-hospital management and clinical course, data from a systematic evaluation has been not reported yet.\n"

                "Since the turn of the century especially small, local retailers struggle with the advent of e-commerce. It is hence no surprise that the retail sector is one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current pandemic. To understand the short- and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on retail, we conducted two surveys to understand ongoing changes in the sector. By contrasting changing consumer behavior with the actions taken by local retailers, we assess whether the current pandemic is potentially a catalyst for e-commerce in Belgium. We do this based on a newly constructed framework of e-retail accessibility, as the differences between online and physical retail require a revision of the traditional economic geographical perspective on retail performance as introduced by Christaller (1933). We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic holds ample opportunities for an increase in the three components of e-retail accessibility, but that a lack of professionalism might prevent traditional local retailers to retain a share of the expanded online market. This could well mean the final blow for local brick and mortar shops if, as is predicted, the share of online shopping in total retail expenditure remains high after the pandemic.\n" +
                        "۱٫ Introduction\n" +
                        "The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting governmental restrictions hit the retail sector hard. While in the second quarter of 2020 the GDP in the Euro-area was down 12% year-on-year, the sales of non-food products dropped by 23.8% in April 2020 compared to a year before. Although total retail trade volume almost recovered after the months of crisis, the constitution of this volume changed dramatically, with mail orders and the internet taking over traditional sales (Eurostat, 2020b, 2020c, 2020b). The temporary closure of stores, bars and restaurants, social distancing rules and contact restrictions and the limitation of non-essential travel halted physical shopping and reshuffled a sector already at a turning point.\n" +
                        "Indeed, even before the spring of 2020 the traditional perspective on the organization of the retail sector was under scrutiny and examples of physical stores in decline were plentiful (Dolega and Lord, 2020). On the one hand, hypermobility and more free time since the 1960s implied that consumers were not anymore bound to the closest outlet, suggesting the range, i.e. the distance and time a consumer is willing to travel for reaching a shop, significantly expanded. In addition, the increased mobility and scaling up in new formats drove a decentralization of retail activities out of the inner cities (Lord and Guy, 1999). On the other hand, online shopping on its turn was about to erase the notion of range as a measure of distance altogether (Cairncross, 2001) and required a revision of retail strategies (Hagberg et al., 2017). Resultantly there are plenty of examples of retail areas in decline and structural changes in shopping real estate (Singleton et al., 2016).\n"

This paper has a conceptual and empirical motivation based on two objectives. First, it identifies several of the primary factors behind the vulnerability of tourism to COVID-19 (tourism dependency, market structure, the supply of rural accommodation, and health incidence of the pandemic). Second, it constructs a vulnerability index to COVID-19 using Spain and its 50 provinces as case. The main results obtained indicate that tourism to the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, the provinces of the Mediterranean coast, and Madrid, in which the state capital is located, present higher vulnerability to COVID-19, yet with different underlying factors. Our methodology and results are of interest to policymakers in terms of the short- and medium-term strategic policies that can be employed to mitigate current and future shocks.\n" +

                            "The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a severe blow to global tourism and leisure sectors, including the hospitality subsector and its entire value chain. With the seclusion of the population since March (in Europe) and the closure of international borders in many countries, hotel and tourism demand approached zero between April and mid-June, beginning a process (perhaps temporary) of deglobalization (Niewiadomsky, 2020). The fall in the activity will probably be historic (higher than in the 2018 financial crisis) even in a fast recovery scenario around the last quarter of the year. The latest UNWTO forecasts (UNWTO, 2020a) point to various scenarios that see a decrease in international arrivals by 58% and 78%. The socio-economic consequences will be enormous, as tourism is a major economic sector providing livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people.2\n" +
                            "Spain has a prominent place among the countries affected by the current pandemic. The latest estimates of the IMF indicate the GDP in Spain would contract by around 12.8% in 2020 (IMF, 2020). With a tourism sector accounting for around 12.3% of the Spanish GDP (and 12.7% of employment), a considerable part of the impact would be seen in the tourism sector. In fact, according to Exceltur (2020), half of the expected drop in the country’s annual GDP corresponds to tourism, that is, a contraction of almost 44,000 million in foreign currency compared to 2019. However, the impact within Spain is not expected to be evenly distributed. Thus, despite the substantial global and sectoral impact, the results in each territory will vary depending on various specific factors linked to demand (e.g., the weight of the domestic market), supply, or the mitigation and adaptation policies (the emergency response to COVID-19).\n"

By identifying the effect of COVID-19 event strength on avoidance coping behaviors, the behaviors isolated from customers unlikely beneficial for tourism enterprises, we not only revealed that COVID-19 event strength indirectly affects avoidance coping behaviors through either the fear of external threat or psychological safety, but also disclosed that supervisor safety support would moderate the effect of psychological safety on such coping behaviors. We argue that understanding potential causes, such as the fear of external threat and psychological safety, and identifying possible solutions, like supervisor safety support, may be key factors for restarting tourism enterprises successfully under the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n" +

                            "Given its person-to-person transmission (Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020), COVID-19 rapidly spreading globally becomes a pandemic (Shi et al., 2020), which caused travel and mobility bans, community lockdowns, and people to remain at home with devastating impacts on tourism and hospitality (Gössling et al., 2020; Kock et al., 2020). Thus, the issues on how to cope with the impacts of COVID-19 for tourism and hospitality have been got much attention. Abel et al. (2020) argued that most owners and managers of tourism enterprises would endeavor to discover how to adjust and modify the manner by which they conduct business in consideration of COVID-19. Bartsch et al. (2021) found that an effective means to maintain the work performance of employees in a virtual environment under the impacts of COVID-19 was to adopt either task- or relation-oriented leadership behavior. In short, the previous studies mainly focused on how to respond to COVID-19 from the enterprise perspective. However, due to reduced occupancy and closed accommodation (Park et al., 2020), operations in tourism and hospitality enterprises have considerably declined worldwide (Kreiner & Ram, 2020), resulting in massive job loss (Kaushal & Srivastava, 2021). As a result, Employees afraid of being layoff off or nearly unemployed likely affect the operating performance of tourism and hospitality enterprises. As a result, it would be essential to shed light on the issues of employees in such enterprises under the severe impact of COVID-19.\n" +
                            "Notably, sadness and anxiety may be the main emotions experienced by employees (Park et al., 2020; Sah et al., 2020). Understanding changes in the psychological state and behavior response of employees may be crucial for enterprises facing the COVID-19 epidemic (Kock et al., 2020). However, the employees’ response behaviors to the impacts of COVID-19 in the tourism and hospitality industry seem to have been rarely explored in relevant studies. Sigala (2020) indicated that COVID-19 tourism research should provide a deeper examination and understanding of the tourism stakeholders’ behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and ideological actions as well as their reactions to the serious impact of COVID-19. In practice, many hotels served as isolation sites for suspected COVID-19-infected individuals due to decreasing room occupancy by tourists after the outbreak of the pandemic. However, many tourist attractions, including hotels, have provided free access for tourists, likely resulting in mass gatherings, which might disadvantage precautions against COVID-19.\n"

Tourism becomes the main driver of growth in many countries and regions. With a strong social interaction nature, the industry is prone to recession, terrorism, natural disasters and infectious diseases. The outbreak of the coronavirus disease in late 2019 (hereafter, COVID-19) has severely and rapidly impacted human life on a global scale with respiratory illness that has effected more than 67 million infected cases and more than one and half million of deaths at the time of writing, an unprecedented crisis. Governments across the globe have taken wartime-like actions to curtail the spread of the illness and deaths by imposing strong restrictions on travel, social gathering and social distancing regulations. The social distancing measures constrain both the demand and supply sides of tourism services, causing significant flow-on effects throughout affected countries (OECD, 2020a, 2020b) with large reductions in employment and losses to household income. Even if a vaccine is available soon, with demand side recovery aided by progressive lifting of travel and social distancing restrictions, tourism supply chains may take years to adjust to the new circumstances of the travel experience (Gössling et al., 2020)\n"

The ProQuest library database was used to collect 192 newspaper articles. The software Qualtrics Text iQ and Leximancer were used to track sentiments, identify themes and concepts correlating with literature on tourism crisis management. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic yields a negatively lower sentiment value for New Zealand, than Singapore’s higher sentiment value.

We develop a strategy for calibrating and validating a model. Our results using historic data from 4 countries provide insights into on-going disease suppression measures, while visualisation of reported data provides up-to-date condition monitoring of the pandemic status.

To control the pandemic, most governments have issued recommendations such as intensified hand hygiene and have taken measures such as closing borders, enforcing lockdowns, etc. These NPIs reduce infection rates, keeping the number of severe cases below hospital capacity limit, a strategy popularly referred to as ‘flattening the curve’. A significant challenge is to identify and efficiently evaluate the effect that active and varying NPIs have on the disease transmission rate.

These dimensionless numbers describe the average number of expected secondary infections generated by each infected person in the absence and presence of controlled interventions. Current opinion suggests that the COVID-19 has a basic reproduction number ~2–۳٫ Although a recent review (Liu et al., 2020) compared twelve studies published from the 1st of January to the 7th of February 2020 which reported a range of values for the COVID-19 basic reproduction number between 1.5 and 6.68. This apparent disparity arises because the reported number depends on country, culture, the stage of the outbreak and calculation method used. NPIs aim to slow the spread of the virus and reduce the effective reproduction number to a sustained value less than one so that the pandemic will eventually die out. Scientists and governments in many countries around the world use the effective reproduction number as an illustrative metric to explain and justify the introduction and relaxation of NPIs (Fauci et al., 2020).\n"

                    "Healthcare waste comprises the waste generated by healthcare facilities, medical laboratories and biomedical research facilities. Improper treatment of this waste poses serious risks of disease transmission to waste pickers, waste workers, health workers, patients, and the community in general through exposure to infectious agents. Poor management of the waste emits harmful and deleterious contaminants into society. However, contamination of highly contagious agents such as the COVID-19 virus has created enormous instability in healthcare waste handling and subsequent recycling because of the volume of the waste generated and its contagious nature. Several countries have adopted safety measures to combat this contamination and manage healthcare waste; however, these measures are insufficient and vary depending on the context of the country. In addition, the WHO has set out guidelines for management of healthcare waste. These guidelines are helping to manage the highly contagious healthcare waste resulting from the current pandemic. Proper healthcare waste management may add value by reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus and increasing the recyclability of materials instead of sending them to landfill. Disinfecting and sorting out healthcare waste facilitates sustainable management and allows their utilization for valuable purposes. This review discusses the different healthcare solid waste management strategies practiced in different countries, the challenges faced during this management, and the possible solutions for overcoming these challenges. It also provides useful insights into healthcare solid waste management scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic and a possible way forward.\n" +

                            "After radiation waste, healthcare waste is considered the second most hazardous waste globally. It includes various forms of waste, both hazardous and non-hazardous, such as sharps, human body parts, blood, chemical waste, pharmaceutical waste, and medical devices (Rodriguez-Morales, 2013). All of this waste is produced mainly by hospitals, primary care facilities, laboratories, mortuaries, autopsy centers, laboratories, blood banks, nursing homes, and other medical locations (Pepin et al., 2014). It is generated during diagnosis, treatment, immunization of humans or animals, research, or the production or testing of biologicals. If not properly handled, it can have devastating effects on human health (Johannessen et al., 2000). During any infectious disease outbreak, the waste generated from healthcare facilities increases exponentially; as a result, special care must be taken by management in order to avoid troubling impacts (Ramteke and Sahu, 2020).\n" +
                            "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has arisen from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes an acute respiratory disease (Mol and Caldas, 2020; WHO, 2019; WHO, 2020b); it was first reported in Wuhan, China (Wang et al., 2020) in December 2019. It has been acknowledged as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (Wilder-Smith and Osman, 2020), and the virus has spread to almost all countries across the globe. The pandemic continues to be a significant public health threat worldwide. The rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 infected patients and the highly transmissible nature of the disease have led to a high number of hospitalizations.\n"

                    "The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown have been a seismic shock for youth in India, elevating their risk of mental health problems like depression. This cross-sectional study sought to measure the point prevalence levels of depression in university students (ages 19–۲۵ years) from Maharashtra, India, during the peak of the frst wave of the pandemic and lockdown, through an online opt-in survey. The BDI-II was self-administered by 783 respondents (males=243; females=540). Results indicated overall mild levels of depression (mean BDI=16.48) and high point prevalence, with 51.8% (n=406) of the population being symptomatic, of which 16.3% had severe, 17.9% had moderate, and 17.8% had mild levels of depression. No association was found with age, gender, educational level of participants, period of hostel stay, education, and occupational level of parents. Overall percentages of symptomatic women were higher, suggesting the gendered efects of the pandemic. This study explored the symptomatology of depression wherein “sadness,” “changes in sleep patterns,” and “concentration difculties” emerged as the most commonly experienced symptoms. Symptom expression was found to vary with intensity and gender. Symptomatic men experienced signifcantly more cognitive symptoms like self-criticalness, punishment feelings, thoughts about past failures, and changes in sleep patterns, while symptomatic women felt signifcantly high “loss of energy.” No signifcant gender diferences were seen in the experience of cognitive-afective symptoms. Possible reasons are discussed. Further exploration of the experiences of youth is essential to understand the full gamut of the pandemic’s impact on them.et al., 2014), and has been declared a priority mental health disorder by the World Health Organization (WHO). Depression occurring during this life stage is associated with various physiological and psychological comorbidities (irritable bowel syndrome, pain, cancers, osteoporosis, substance abuse, anxiety, truancy, risk-taking behaviors, self-harm) that have a ripple efect on several important biopsychosocial aspects of the growing adolescent’s life. In India, depression is the leading non-fatal disease burden on youth and the primary disruptor of their development, education, and growth. It is the primary source of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), contributing to challenging economic consequences for self and family (Arvind et al., 2019; Sagar et al., 2020)."

The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorised COVID-19 as a pandemic infection since the respiratory illness it causes is highly contagious 5 because of the novelty of the virus, its rapid spread and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies.6 The spread of COVID-19 presents serious risks globally and in Saudi Arabia, which has reported 393 377 cases and 6704 deaths as of 06 April 2021.7 Saudi Arabia has exceptional circumstances as it is a hub for millions of foreign workers and pilgrims from across the globe. In response to the pandemic and to combat the spread of the disease, the government took swift action and closed the two holy mosques, suspended travel to the country, closed most businesses and limited individuals’ movement. Further, the government created a national narrative to encourage citizens to adhere to the emergency measures established in response to the pandemic.6 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia took the deadly coronavirus outbreak seriously, even before the Ministry of Health announced the first confirmed COVID-19 case; for example, it announced the temporary suspension of entry to Makkah and Madinah in February 2020.8 After the first confirmed case, the government announced a series of extreme measures to control the spread of the virus, beginning on 8 March with a ban on all transport in and out of the Qatif Governorate"

                            "The response rate was 14.5%. Of 1521 HCP with a known profession, 607 (39.9%) were nursing personnel, 480 (31.6%) physicians, 171 (11.2%) paramedical personnel, 72 (4.7%) supportive personnel, and 191 (12.6%) administrative personnel. Overall, 803 of 1571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009–۲۰۱۰, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020–۲۰۲۱, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients.\n" +

HCP have been recognized as a high-risk group for occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and onset of clinical illness, while fatalities occurred [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Moreover, high rates of absenteeism were noted among HCP, either because of infection or for post-exposure isolation purposes [[7]].\n" +
                            "Starting this autumn, healthcare facilities around the world are experiencing an unprecedented surge of healthcare demands in association with a considerable influx of patients [[1],[8]]. HCP constitute a high-priority group for COVID-19 vaccination [[9],[10]]. Aside from protection of HCP, the rationale for vaccination relies also on the need to preserve the essential healthcare services from outbreaks and HCP absenteeism [[9]]. The underlying arguments for HCP prioritization for vaccination also include the principle of reciprocity, given their work under intense conditions, putting themselves but also potentially their households at higher risk for the sake of patients [[9]].\n"

                            "After the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, governments around the world imposed a series of lockdowns. Non-essential businesses closed for several weeks, travel became difficult, social gatherings were limited, and officials from national and regional governments advised people to stay at home. All of these restrictions sought to accomplish social distancing, a vital public health tool used to contain the rapid growth of emerging infectious diseases (Fong et al., 2020). In essence, these stay-at-home orders modified most social structures, including criminal activity.\n" +
                            "Until recently, research on the net effect of a large-scale lockdown on criminal activity was non-existent. New efforts within the criminal justice discipline are filling the knowledge gap. We aim to expand this literature by studying the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime in Mexico City, using records from Mexico City’s Attorney General’s Office. The particular context of Mexico offers a glimpse into the effects of a lockdown on crime in a developing economy that shares many characteristics with other countries in Latin America. In particular, Mexico has a significant presence of organized criminal enterprises —besides conventional criminals—and institutional weaknesses in the criminal justice system.\n" +
                            "The stay-at-home order time-line in Mexico City was similar to the rest of the world. In December 2020, an epidemic of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China. The virus spread quickly throughout Asia (e.g. Iran) and then Europe (e.g., Italy and Spain) during the first three months of 2020, and made its way to North America in February 2020. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 became a pandemic, as pronounced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The following week, restaurants, gyms, clubs, and universities began to shut down voluntarily in Mexico City. On March 23, 2020, the federal government officially started the “social distancing” campaign, and the whole country went under lockdown. Schools, government offices, malls, parks, and non-essential businesses closed temporarily down in Mexico City.\n"

The influence will be checked under the moderating effect of the perceived threat of COVID-19 and the perceived health risk of the customers. The data from 224 customers were collected who have visited banks in India since March 2020. The data were analysed through the partial least square method of structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3.2. The findings of the study suggested that the efficacy of the screening system of COVID-19 positively influences the brand image and customer satisfaction. The moderating role of the perceived health risk of the customers and perceived threat of COVID-19 has been confirmed between the screening system of COVID-19 and brand image.

The pandemic of COVID-19 started on 31 December 2019 after the World Health Organization (WHO) witnessed the first case in Wuhan, China. A global health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020 by WHO, the sixth such emergency in history. WHO declared this infectious disease as pandemic based on its spread all over the world. The fatality rate of this virus is comparatively low than previous pandemics; however, the infection rate of the virus is high. On this day, the total number of people infected by this virus is 104, 458, 203 across the globe and 10,778,206 in India,Footnote1 which stands second in the list after the USA. With the surge in the number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19 and its highly infectious nature, there has been a necessity for a safe and efficient screening system (Kwon et al. 2020). The screening system may consist of a questionnaire containing personal information, epidemiologic factors and declaration of related symptoms at the entrance gate, body temperature examination using a contactless thermometer or an automated temperature screening machine.\n" +

Building upon the ongoing experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this short communication, we discuss three potential mechanisms that, in our opinion, can mitigate the impacts of major crises or disasters in agriculture: resilience-promoting policies, community marketing schemes, and smart farming technology. We argue that resilience-promoting policies should focus on the development of crisis management plans and enhance farmers’ capacity to cope with external disturbances. We also stress the need to promote community marketing conduits that ensure an income floor for farmers while in parallel facilitating consumer access to agrifood products when mainstream distribution channels under-serve them. Finally, we discuss some issues that need to be solved to ensure that smart technology and big data can help farmers overcome external shocks.\n" +

After the identification of the first infections in China in December 2019, the virus began surging in other countries in February 2020 (Pedrosa, 2020). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (WHO, 2020). To protect public health, governments around the world – even those whose leaders expressed denial of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic – initiated several measures (ranging from media announcements to partial or even complete lockdown) to mitigate the disease. These measures led to profound changes in consumers buying behavior and food consumption patterns, disturbances in transportation networks, and the closure of some food suppliers (Nakat & Bou-Mitri, 2020). Such an upheaval created uncertainty shocks that impacted every sector of social and economic life, including agriculture.\n"

                    "The study stipulates phases to observe the proposed mechanism in formulating the travel and leisure industry’s recovery strategies. The present pandemic COVID-19 has resulted in global challenges, economic and healthcare crises, and posed spillover impacts on the global industries, including tourism and travel that the major contributor to the service industry worldwide. The tourism and leisure industry has faced the COVID-19 tourism impacts hardest-hit and lies among the most damaged global industries. The leisure and internal tourism indicated a steep decline amounting to 2.86 trillion US dollars, which quantified more than 50% revenue losses. In the first step, the study explores the consequences and settings of the COVID-19 pandemic and how innovation and change can contribute to the tourism industry’s revival to the next normal. Thus, the study determines that tourism enterprises and scholars must consider and change the basic principles, main assumptions, and organizational situations related to research and practice framework through rebuilding and establishing the tourism sector. In the second step, the study discusses direct COVID-19 tourism impacts, attitudes, and practices in gaining the leisure industry’s boom and recovery. In the third phase, the study proposes to observe the characteristics and COVID-19 tourism consequences on the travel and tourism research. The findings provide insights in regaining the tourism industry’s operational activities and offer helpful suggestions to government officials, scholars, and tourism firms to reinvest in the tourism industry to set it back to a normal position.\n" +

                            "The appearance of the lethal disease COVID-19 has resulted in massive financial losses and caused global health and economic crises worldwide (Anderson et al., 2020; McKenna and Bargh, 1998; Brewer, 2016). The most frightening news of the seasonal influenza outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, and catastrophes results in a steep decrease in the travel and tourism industry, a dominant contributor to the service industry (Abbas, 2021; Jones et al., 2015; Avery, 2010). The pandemics adversely impact tourists’ behaviors and their mental wellbeing (Aman et al., 2019; Bauer et al., 2021; Park et al., 2019). As a result, they drop their planned tour plans in fear of the disease infection, as it looks impossible to avoid transmission of the virus during travel (Mamirkulova et al., 2020; Avery, 2017; Meadows et al., 2019). Besides, tourists travel increases infection risk to other air passengers in the absence of effective vaccines (Su et al., 2021; Hu and Zhang, 2014; Reynolds and W.S., 2005; Tonsaker et al., 2014). Travelers play a significant role in transferring viruses, epidemics’, outbreaks, or pandemics between local communities’ destinations (Hollingsworth et al., 2006; Abbott, 2021; Zhong et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018). At present, the entire world is facing crisis communication in the media (Su et al., 2021). The adverse consequences of the COVID-19 on the travel and leisure industry resulted in novel viral disease appurtenance (Su et al., 2020). Infectious viruses are highly contagious, mutate rapidly and increase mortality (Local Burden of Disease, H.I.V.C. 2021).\n"

                    "We implement the stress test methodology of the banking industry in conjunction with a Logit model of bankruptcy with parameters estimated with data from the Great Recession (2008–۲۰۱۳) to predict which firms would face financial distress among Spanish hospitality firms during 2020 due to the Covid-19 disaster. The predictions from both methods rely on the last accounting data available and on the expected revenue drop for 2020. Both methods coincide to predict that 25% of these firms will face a financial distress situation if revenues drop 60%. This forecast raises up to 32% of firms if revenues drop 80%. Financial distress will affect mainly small firms. Most of the firms in financial distress will face solvency problems, with total assets being insufficient to pay all debts.\n" +
                            "۱٫ Introduction\n" +
                            "The tourism industry is specially affected by health emergences (Chien & Law, 2003; Dahles & Susilowati, 2015; Dombey, 2003; Mckercher & Chon, 2004; Novelli, Gussing Burgess, Jones, & Ritchie, 2018). For example, in China, the SARS crisis in 2003 strongly affected the tourism industry compared to other industries (Dombey, 2003). The Covid-19 crisis is much stronger— not only for its effect on the tourism industry, reducing total activity by 60–۸۰% in 2020 according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNTWO), but also because it is widespread around the globe, collapsing the world economy. In Spain, where tourism’s relevance to the GDP is close to 15%,1 the overall impact to the economy is devastating. In such situations, recent studies are finding that the financial strength of firms is becoming especially relevant: stock market prices are less affected by the crisis in firms with more cash holdings, lower leverage and more profits (Acharya & Steffen, 2020; Ding, Levine, Lin, & Xie, 2020; Pagano, Wagner, & Zechner, 2020; Ramelli & Wagner, 2020). A natural interpretation of this finding is that investors do not expect financial markets to provide the financial resources firms will need to resist this crisis period (Ramelli & Wagner, 2020). The financial markets also predict this issue to be more relevant in industries where it is more problematic to maintain social distance measures, like in the hotel industry (Pagano et al., 2020).\n" +
                            "In a stable or growing period, cash holdings are of little value since firms may easily access financial markets to obtain funds, when required. Furthermore, due to the agency conflict between managers and shareholders, cash holdings may generate negative incentives to executives and reduce shareholder value (Jensen, 1986). However, in the Covid-19 crisis stock market prices anticipate the difficulty many firms face to obtain the financial resources to survive this crisis period. Firms with low cash holdings, high financial leverage and with a history of low profits are at a disadvantage (Acharya & Steffen, 2020; Ramelli & Wagner, 2020). Past research in the hotel industry found that the financial structure of firms is irrelevant for the probability tourism firms’ survival (G´emar, Moniche, & Morales, 2016). Indeed, little attention has been paid to the financial strength of hospitality firms in past literature which studies their performance (Claver-Cort´es, Molina-Azorín, & Pereira-Moliner, 2006; Sainaghi, Phillips, & Zavarrone, 2017). Other characteristics of firms, such as the geographical location or the type of service attracted more attention (Assaf & Tsionas, 2018). However, a period with little revenues generates a strong need for financial resources in hospitality firms to survive and pay fixed costs, which are quite relevant in these firms (Nicolau, 2005). This situation could be easily solved in many firms if they had access to bank loans and/or financial markets operated properly, providing these firms with the needed financial resources to survive. This is something that changed in the Covid-19 crisis and that the previous literature on hospitality firms does not consider.\n"

Accordingly, scholars have begun to seek the best methods to predict the recovery of tourism from the devastating effects of COVID-19. In this study, econometric and judgmental methods were combined to forecast the possible paths to tourism recovery in Hong Kong. The autoregressive distributed lag-error correction model was used to generate baseline forecasts, and Delphi adjustments based on different recovery scenarios were performed to reflect different levels of severity in terms of the pandemic’s influence.

                            "In many places, tourism has become a strategic pillar industry, given its increasingly significant contributions to the local gross domestic product (GDP). Despite its importance, tourism is also one of the most vulnerable industries. The tourism industry has experienced significant negative effects during so-called “black swan” crisis events, such as the financial crises in 1997 and 2008, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, and various earthquakes and episodes of social unrest. Business operations are contingent on forecasts. However, forecasts generated using traditional methods might be out-of-date and ineffective in a crisis. Therefore, a useful method that can produce accurate forecasts for both academia and business purposes is urgently needed.\n" +
                            "Since late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented global health and social emergencies and profound negative impacts on the global economy. By September 30, 2020, 33,561,077 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,005,004 deaths had been reported worldwide (World Health Organization; WHO, 2020). The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) reported that by April 20, 2020, all major tourist destinations had implemented travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (UNWTO, 2020). Tourism is among the industries most negatively affected by this pandemic. Lockdowns in many countries, widespread travel restrictions, and airport and national border closures reduced the number of international tourist arrivals by 67 million during the first quarter of 2020 (2020Q1). This decrease implies a loss of approximately US$80 billion in tourism revenue, compared with the same period in 2019 (UNWTO, 2020).\n" +
                            "Hong Kong, which is known as the Pearl of the Orient, blends Eastern and Western cultures and is famous for its gourmet and shopping opportunities. Since the late 1980s, Hong Kong has vigorously developed its service sector. In 1989, the total tourist arrivals in Hong Kong were only 5,361,170 (Census and Statistics Department, 1990). By 2018, this number had increased to 65.15 million, with annual tourist revenues of HK$328.2 billion (Tourism Commission, 2019). In the first half of 2019, Hong Kong welcomed 34,871,856 inbound tourists, and this number represented a 13.9% increase relative to 2018 (Gov. HK, 2020).\n"

                    "As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and low vaccination rates, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics.\n" +
                            "Introduction\n" +
                            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a human infectious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading all across the world in 213 countries, which results in over 88 million cumulative cases of COVID-19 illness as of January 2021 [2]. So far, the COVID-19 pandemic situation is not optimistic due to many factors including the low vaccination rates [3] and unavailable pharmaceutical treatment for COVID-19. The spreading control of COVID-19 mainly depends on the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [4], such as contact tracing, quarantine, and social distancing. On the one hand, the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is still a mystery, which requires more longitudinal studies to figure out. However, it has been known that the immunity to other coronaviruses (e.g, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) gradually wanes over time and the coronavirus reinfections exist [5]. Similarly, the immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible to be short-term instead of permanent. Based on the prediction from Harvard Public Health School [4], the COVID-19 outbreaks would occur recurrently and regularly if the immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent. Even if it is permanent, SARS-CoV-2 could be spreading for many years.\n" +
                            "On the other hand, the non-pharmaceutical interventions do contribute to mitigating the severity of COVID-19 epidemics. A study [4] estimates that social distancing could successfully yield a 60% reduction of COVID-19 infections [4]. The combined non-pharmaceutical interventions, involving self-isolation and public events banning, have effectively controlled the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in some regions like Europe [6] and China [7]. Although the non-pharmaceutical interventions are particularly important to COVID-19 prevention and control, it is worth noticing that these interventions probably have profound influence on the economy and society [8]. Also, the interventions, such as prolonged self-isolation and complete city lockdown, have impacts on people’s both physical [9] and mental health [10]. It is thus highly desirable to build a more intelligent and systematic implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to ensure effective COVID-19 control with the minimal possible impacts on our lives and society.\n"

Despite the worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), information about the epidemiological and clinical patterns of this infection is still largely unknown in children. In addition, the prevalence of this disease is still very high in some parts of the world, including Iran. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the epidemiological features, laboratory and imaging findings, and the type of treatments in children with novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Method. This study is conducted from March 2020–March 2021 by using the medical records of hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 children younger than 18 years in five cities of Iran: Tehran, Ahwaz, Isfahan, Bandar-Abbas, and Khorramabad. In addition to demographic and epidemiological data, we also studied clinical signs and treatments. Results. In total 278 confirmed COVID-19 children, the average age was 5.3 years, and 59.4%were boys. A total of 37.8% had an underlying disease, in which the most common was a malignancy. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. In this group of pediatrics, some abnormal laboratory findings have been seen. GGO (Ground-Glass Opacity) had been diagnosed in 58.6% of children. 3.6% needed oxygen therapy with ventilators, and 83.09% had received antibiotic treatments with the majority of ceftriaxone. Also, 10% had got steroids. In this study, the mortality rate was 4.3%. Conclusion. In this study, most of the children who died had an underlying disease, so timely care and action is important in them. Most children admitted to our study received antibiotics and were prescribed antivirals and steroids for a smaller number. Also, a small number of children received oxygen therapy, most of whom were in the age group of 1 to 5 years.\n" +

COVID-19 is a dangerous respiratory infection that rapidly spreads from humans to humans.

IoMT is a remote healthcare system, which is mainly composed of medical sensor devices, medical data servers, and professional medical staff (i.e., doctors, nurses, and so on). The medical sensor devices (including various biomedical sensors, RFID tags, and QR tags) collect the medical data of patients and then transmit the data to medical data servers.

                            "The recent Covid-19 outbreak and the resulting restrictions, including city lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing, and closure orders, have caused a sharp decline in tourism (UNWTO, 2020). This has posed an existential threat to the hospitality industry, which is heavily reliant on tourist flow (The Guardian, 2020). The occupancy rate of hotels in China suffered a decline of 75 % over 2 weeks in early 2020 due to the crisis (STR, 2020). Besides pandemic-induced crises, the hospitality industry is vulnerable to other crises such as political instability (Corbet et al., 2019), terrorism (Israeli and Reichel, 2003), economic recession (Qu et al., 2002), and natural disaster (Chen, 2011). Due to the increasing occurrence and significant impacts of various crises, numerous crisis management studies have been conducted to identify the causes of crisis occurrence (e.g., Racherla and Hu, 2009; Yu, Stafford, & Armoo, 2006) and the impacts of crises on firms (Chen, 2011; Pine and McKercher, 2004). Likewise, studies have examined how firms can manage crises to mitigate the negative impacts and avoid disruption to daily operations (Henderson, 2007; Leung and Lam, 2004; Pappas, 2015).\n" +
                            "Focusing on a particular problem or perspective, each study provides a valuable contribution to the overall understanding of crisis and crisis management. However, as the literature on crisis research continues to grow and accumulate, it becomes increasingly difficult to grasp the central conclusion of the broad crisis management literature, and to identify areas where more research is necessary. Thus, reviewing the status and development of crisis research on a regular basis is critical for research in this area to advance with greater rigor and relevance (Lamberton and Stephen, 2016). Several researchers have attempted to do this. Mair et al. (2016) reviewed 64 articles concerning post-disaster and post-crisis recovery related to destinations and tourist flow. More recently, Jiang, Ritchie, and Benckendorff (2019) reviewed tourism crisis research by exploring its network structure using bibliometric analysis. Ritchie and Jiang (2019) reviewed 142 articles on tourism crisis and disaster management using a narrative synthesis approach. They discussed three critiques of the existing literature, including a lack of conceptual and theoretical foundations, a lack of framework testing, and unbalanced research themes. Despite their significant contribution to the crisis literature, these reviews have focused solely on the tourism industry. While hospitality is a vital component of the overall tourism experience (Davidson et al., 2010), hospitality and tourism are two closely related yet divided subfields that should be disaggregated into two distinct research areas (Jamal et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2014). To date, no research has provided a systematic review and a synthesis of crisis research with a specific focus on the hospitality field (Pennington-Gray, 2018; Racherla and Hu, 2009).\n"

                    "Given the substantial impact of crisis on the hospitality industry, crisis and crisis management have drawn attention from scholars. While each study makes a significant contribution to the existing knowledge of crisis management in hospitality, the fragmented perspective of each study makes it difficult to identify the key findings and unsolved problems. This paper presents a synthesis and critical assessment of state-of-the-art crisis management research in hospitality. It categorizes articles based on a three-stage framework covering pre-crisis planning, mid-crisis management, and post-crisis recovery. Two main perspectives in the literature are identified: one from hospitality service providers and one from stakeholders. Core research topics and concepts in each stage and perspective are reviewed. In addition, this paper proposes four major directions for future research: crisis management from stakeholders’ perspectives, integrative research, causal and behavioral research, and theoretical enhancement. It discusses the theoretical and practical implications of this study.\n" +

                            "The recent Covid-19 outbreak and the resulting restrictions, including city lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing, and closure orders, have caused a sharp decline in tourism (UNWTO, 2020). This has posed an existential threat to the hospitality industry, which is heavily reliant on tourist flow (The Guardian, 2020). The occupancy rate of hotels in China suffered a decline of 75 % over 2 weeks in early 2020 due to the crisis (STR, 2020). Besides pandemic-induced crises, the hospitality industry is vulnerable to other crises such as political instability (Corbet et al., 2019), terrorism (Israeli and Reichel, 2003), economic recession (Qu et al., 2002), and natural disaster (Chen, 2011). Due to the increasing occurrence and significant impacts of various crises, numerous crisis management studies have been conducted to identify the causes of crisis occurrence (e.g., Racherla and Hu, 2009; Yu, Stafford, & Armoo, 2006) and the impacts of crises on firms (Chen, 2011; Pine and McKercher, 2004). Likewise, studies have examined how firms can manage crises to mitigate the negative impacts and avoid disruption to daily operations (Henderson, 2007; Leung and Lam, 2004; Pappas, 2015).\n" +
                            "Focusing on a particular problem or perspective, each study provides a valuable contribution to the overall understanding of crisis and crisis management. However, as the literature on crisis research continues to grow and accumulate, it becomes increasingly difficult to grasp the central conclusion of the broad crisis management literature, and to identify areas where more research is necessary. Thus, reviewing the status and development of crisis research on a regular basis is critical for research in this area to advance with greater rigor and relevance (Lamberton and Stephen, 2016). Several researchers have attempted to do this. Mair et al. (2016) reviewed 64 articles concerning post-disaster and post-crisis recovery related to destinations and tourist flow. More recently, Jiang, Ritchie, and Benckendorff (2019) reviewed tourism crisis research by exploring its network structure using bibliometric analysis. Ritchie and Jiang (2019) reviewed 142 articles on tourism crisis and disaster management using a narrative synthesis approach. They discussed three critiques of the existing literature, including a lack of conceptual and theoretical foundations, a lack of framework testing, and unbalanced research themes.\n"

                    "In regard to the global pandemic of COVID-19, it seems that persons with epilepsy (PWE) are not more vulnerable to get infected by SARS-CoV-2, nor are they more susceptible to a critical course of the disease. However, management of acute seizures in patients with COVID-19 as well as management of PWE and COVID-19 needs to consider potential drug-drug interactions between antiseizure drugs and candidate drugs currently assessed as therapeutic options for COVID-19. Repurposing of several licensed and investigational drugs is discussed for therapeutic management of COVID-19. While for none of these approaches, efficacy and tolerability has been confirmed yet in sufficiently powered and controlled clinical studies, testing is ongoing with multiple clinical trials worldwide. Here, we have summarized the possible mechanisms of action of drugs currently considered as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 management along with possible and confirmed drug-drug interactions that should be considered for a combination of antiseizure drugs and COVID-19 candidate drugs. Our review suggests that potential drug-drug interactions should be taken into account with drugs such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir while remdesivir and tocilizumab may be less prone to clinically relevant interactions with ASMs.\n" +

                            "The catastrophic global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put large parts of the world on a transient standstill. COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and the causative agent was a novel subtype of beta-coronaviruses, known as SARS-CoV-2 (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). The novel coronavirus is an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus (Richman et al., 2016) that was transmitted to humans via zoonotic transmission, similar to its precursors, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ksiazek et al., 2003) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012). These viruses primarily affect the respiratory system, however, clinical literature also provides evidence for neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2 (Carod-Artal, 2020; Li et al., 2020b; Najjar et al., 2020). Neurological symptoms reported in patients with COVID-19 include febrile seizures, status epilepticus and complications including encephalopathy, cerebral haemorrhage (Asadi-Pooya, 2020; Asadi-Pooya and Simani, 2020; Carod-Artal, 2020; Yin et al., 2020). These clinical manifestations suggest that people with neurological disorders may be more vulnerable to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease. However, that does not seem to be the case. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has informed that persons with epilepsy (PWE) are not likely to be more susceptible to get COVID-19 nor are they inclined to suffer through severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ILAE, 2020). Even if PWE are exposed to SARS-CoV-2, it is unlikely that the frequency of seizures increases (ILAE, 2020). Nevertheless, management of COVID-19 in PWE or with acute reactive seizures requires certain precautions and guidelines to avoid worsening of the condition. In particular, potential drug-drug interaction that may occur on concomitant administration of anti-seizure medication (ASM) along with the drugs for treatment of COVID-19 need to be taken into account.\n"

                    "The COVID-19 pandemics has created unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Among other important risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, obesity has emerged along with undernutrition-malnutrition as a strong predictor of disease risk and severity. Obesity-related excessive body fat may lead to respiratory, metabolic and immune derangements potentially favoring the onset of COVID-19 complications. In addition, patients with obesity may be at risk for loss of skeletal muscle mass, reflecting a state of hidden malnutrition with a strong negative health impact in all clinical settings. Also importantly, obesity is commonly associated with micronutrient deficiencies that directly influence immune function and infection risk. Finally, the pandemic-rvelated lockdown, deleterious lifestyle changes and other numerous psychosocial consequences may worsen eating behaviors, sedentarity, body weight regulation, ultimately leading to further increments of obesity-associated metabolic complications with loss of skeletal muscle mass and higher non-communicable disease risk. Therefore, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies should be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients in the presence of obesity; lockdown-induced health risks should also be specifically monitored and prevented in this population. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing clinical practice guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients with obesity in various clinical settings.\n" +

                            "COVID-19 is a primarily respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection that can spread from upper to lower airways, leading to respiratory insufficiency requiring respiratory support and intensive care, where it may be fatal [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Patient groups with pre-existing comorbidities ranging from diabetes and cardiovascular disease to cancer and chronic organ failures, as well as older age, are burdened with higher risk for complications and COVID-19 mortality [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Importantly, both older age and pre-existing chronic diseases in polymorbid individuals are per se associated with high risk and prevalence of undernutrition (which will be hereafter referred to as MALNUTRITION, to align with the utilization of this term in clinical practice as supported by clinical nutrition Societies) [6,7], due to catabolic derangements, low food intake and low physical activity whose various combinations result in loss of body and skeletal muscle mass and muscle function [[6], [7], [8]]. In COVID-19, infection with related inflammation and potential organ failure with systemic complications and immobilization may further contribute to enhance muscle loss and malnutrition risk. Also notably, malnutrition is an independent major cause of morbidity and mortality in most disease conditions, through mechanisms including high risk of infections or superinfection [9], caused by its deleterious impact on immune function [10] as well as respiratory and cardiac muscle function [11,12].\n"

                    "The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected the agrarian and remittance-based economy of Nepal. Dwindling the employment opportunities and disrupting the food production and distribution channels, the pandemic has further exacerbated the unemployment and food insecurity situation. Providing employment opportunities and livelihood support to pandemic-affected households has, therefore, become increasingly challenging but a necessary priority to the government. Therefore, to build a sustainable and resilient economy that generates employment and enhance agricultural productivity, revitalization of the constraints-ridden agriculture sector is essential as it still contributes 65% and 24.3% to employment and Gross Domestic Product, respectively. Against this backdrop, this paper presents major pathways and priority actions to rebuild and revitalize the growth of the agricultural sector in Nepal while addressing the challenge posed by the pandemic to generate employment and income-earning opportunities. We emphasize the need for scale-appropriate strategies, programs and plans to build resilience of production, supply chains, and agribusiness systems. We conclude that the government should initially focus on targeted priority interventions to the pandemic-affected farmers and agro-entrepreneurs, and strengthen their productive, competitive, and adaptive capacities. These need to be followed by long-term strategies such as development of agricultural infrastructure, innovative policies, legal instruments, and institutional arrangements, including strengthening of the recently established local governments in line with the federal structure of Nepal.\n" +

                            "COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic of enormous proportion that has severely affected human lives and the global economy (UNDP, 2020b). The virus has spread to over 213 countries and territories infecting more than 65.1 million people and killing over 1.5 million by 3 December 2020 (Worldometer, 2020). Lockdowns and mobility restrictions have been the common responses to the pandemic, but they have disrupted production, input and output markets, supply chains, global trade, travel, and tourism; delivering an enormous shock to the global economy in 2020 as indicated by early estimates of 495 million job losses and 5.2% contraction on global output (ILO, 2020a; World Bank, 2020b).\n" +

Like many other severely affected countries, Nepal has been experiencing health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Over 237,589 infections and 1551 deaths have been reported in Nepal by 3 December 2020 (MOHP, 2020) and the country has entered a second wave that is more severe than the first (World Bank, 2020f). COVID-19 and associated nationwide complete (from 24 March to 21 July 2020) and partial (after 21 July) lockdowns have severely affected the Nepalese economy through multiple channels: a) the collapse of tourism, trade, and hospitality sectors, affecting over one million jobs; b) loss of foreign jobs and return of migrants, affecting remittance earnings; and c) disruption of production and supply chains of the industrial and agricultural products, affecting the livelihoods of millions of people (Baniya et al., 2020; ILO, 2020b; World Bank, 2020c).\n"

                    "Psychological consequences of COVID-19 More than two and a half million people have already died as a result of COVID-19. There is now considerable evidence in epidimiological studies that the prevalence of mental health problems has substantially increased after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Qiu et al., 2021; Schafer et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020). This does not only apply to adults but to adolescents as well (Breaux et al., 2021). The pandemic has had a direct impact on anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorder and violence (ClementeSuárez et al., 2021). In addition, one study has shown that paranoia and conspiratorial thinking are associated with COVID-19 (Larsen et al., 2021). Research has found an association between COVID-19 related conditions and the perpetration or experience of intimate partner violence during the earliest stage of the pandemic in a sample of adults in the United States (Davis et al., 2021). Respondents who reported testing positive to COVID-19 were two to three times more likely to experience or perpetrate interpersonal violence against an intimate partner. Also in healthcare workers with COVID-19 patients mental health risks have increased (Johnson et al., 2020; Mosheva et al., 2020; Salazar de Pablo et al., 2020; Sheraton et al., 2020). In a study amongst 350 healthcare workers in the US results revealed persisting mental health consequennces of the COVID-19 pandemic among health care workers: Anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, PTSD, and moral injury remained high over 90 days between September and December 2020 (Amsalem et al., 2021).In this Special Issue a number of studies are published which investigate consequences of COVID19 on mental health issues. In a large study on adult participants from the general population across 21 countries worldwide was found that fears of offering compassion to oneself and others, and of receiving compassion from others significantly predicted poorer mental health and social safeness during the COVID-19 pandemic (Matos et al., 2021)."

COVID-19 quickly became a rapidly emerging situation, spreading from the Asian continent to the rest of the world. On January 30, 2020, the disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. Due to the gravity of the situation, most regions and nations, in an effort to reduce and delay population transmission and ultimately lessen the burden on health care systems, enforced strict public health measures, including city and national lockdown measures. To contain the spread of COVID-19, on March 24, 2020, the government of the Republic of Cyprus implemented stringent containment measures and imposed a national lockdown. As a result, almost all avoidable outdoor activities (such as mass gatherings and events) were banned, and the Cypriot population was forced to quarantine themselves at home. Citizens could leave their home only for essentials, such as visiting food markets and pharmacies, and commuting to work when working in person was essential (e.g., health care, supermarkets, etc.) while maintaining physical distancing.\n"

                    "Purpose: The present study examined the risk factors of psychological disorders after COVID-19 outbreak and tested the possible mediating role of social support and emotional intelligence on the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and psychological disorders. Methods: We conducted an online survey from May 25, 2020 until June 10, 2020 among Chinese university students who had been quarantined at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Social support was assessed using the Social Support Rating Scale. Self-perceived emotional competency was measured using a Chinese version of the self-report Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale. The 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to assess nonspecific symptoms of psychological disorders. Results: A total of 6,027 college students participated in the survey, of whom 2,732 (45.3%) reported mental health issues. Men and people in a relationship showed higher frequencies of psychological disorders. Social support and emotional intelligence were both negatively associated with psychological disorders. Stepwise linear regression revealed that the most important predictors of psychological disorders were self-emotion appraisal, family relationships, and showing panic about COVID-19 on the social media. Path analysis suggested that the association between pandemic exposure and psychological disorders was partially mediated by emotional intelligence, but not by social support. Conclusions: Emotional intelligence may mediate the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and psychological disorders. Psychological interventions fostering emotional intelligence and social support should be implemented among university students to reduce the psychological harm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic down the city center of Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic. Daily supplies and medical resources were supported by other provinces. People were asked to refrain from going outdoors as much as possible. The schools delayed the beginning of term and students studied online. In the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, a study found that about one third of respondents reported moderate-tosevere anxiety among the general population in China, and student status was associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak [1]."

                    "This review expands our insight into the ways the required adaptation to digital channels caused by COVID-19 has affected the creation of brand equity through social media marketing. Based on a systematic literature review, we propose a conceptual framework that answers the following research question: How can businesses, amidst and after the COVID-19 pandemic, adapt their social media marketing strategy to create positive brand equity? The conceptual framework describes four components as the basis for a potential social media marketing strategy. First, (1) businesses need to develop a clear perspective on their current social media marketing activities, and (2) evaluate current branding elements. Based on this, (3) the timeline of marketing activities must be postponed or adapted to the needs of consumers. Lastly, (4) businesses must adapt their messaging to show empathy and deliver relevant information. Within this process, governmental parties, financial institutions, influencers, and consumers are identified as stakeholders who influence and assist businesses in optimizing their social media marketing strategy. These findings are relevant for academics and businesses to further understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 on social media marketing. Additionally, they highlight that the roles of online channels and the consumer are expanding in the future.\n" +

                            "The COVID-19 pandemic has created substantial growth for internet-based businesses as an increasing number of consumers are shopping online [1]. In 2020, the global ecommerce market has seen an increase of 27.6%, surpassing over 4.28 trillion US dollars [2]. In the past few years, organizations have been subject to the introduction of digital technologies that transform organizations, interactions with consumers, and the creation of value [3–۵]. Online shopping has created the opportunity to compare products more conveniently and consumers can easily choose the products that fit their needs the most [6]. Mostly young consumers have shifted to online spending, affecting the manner in which businesses have to operate as young consumers are more likely to shop through social media [7]. Additionally, 62% base their purchase decisions on the impact that these have on society, e.g., sustainable and green products, in comparison to 53% of middle-aged consumers and 44% of older consumers [7].\n" +
                            "Subsequently, as more consumers and businesses are adapting to buying and selling through online channels, the digital marketing sphere is becoming more competitive [8]. When looking at the state of digital marketing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, a special emphasis should be put on Social Media Marketing (SMM) as it offers a wide range of tools to target customers more effectively. Social media has also become a large influence on online shopping, as research shows that 54% of purchases made by younger consumers are from independent retailers they discovered via social media [7]; this is 43% for middle-aged consumers and 25% for older consumers. This is especially promising as social media has become a primary communication channel for many and the time consumers spent online has drastically increased since the start of the pandemic [1,9]. As SMM is aimed at the creation of interactions with consumers in the digital settings where they already spend time, businesses can enhance their customer experience by analyzing customers and their conversations [10].\n"

                            "What is COVID-19? Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), also known as the ‘‘Wuhan coronavirus,’’ is an illness caused by the enveloped RNA SARS-CoV-2 virus identified in Wuhan (China), a causative agent of a potentially fatal condition that has become a significant public health concern worldwide.1 The SARS-CoV-2, a member of the betacoronavirus genus, is capable of infecting humans and animals. Coronaviruses are common viruses in nature, and several of them can infect humans, causing mild diseases in the form of colds.2 However, genetic differences between this virus and others from the same family makes it more contagious and aggressive. As a consequence, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) determined that the outbreak of COVID-19 became a Public Health Emergency at the international level.3 WHO Member States were the advised to consider options to prevent the introduction of the disease to new areas or to reduce humanto-human transmission in zones where the virus COVID-19 was already circulating.\n"

                    "The Covid-19 pandemic has long-lasting impacts that require the hotel sector to revise, innovate and transform their businesses. However, the literature related to this area remains vastly under-developed. Based on 219 articles collected from global news media and an integrated crisis management framework, this research note map out “strategic responses” from the hotel sector and suggest implications for hotels to address the evolving pandemic situation. Three modifications were proposed to refine and further develop a pandemic crisis management framework.\n" +
                            "۱٫ Introduction\n" +
                            "The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously disrupted the hotel sector with a projected loss outweighing all previous crises combined, including the 9/11 terrorism attack, 2008 recession or SARS epidemic (Oxford Economics, 2020). The average revenue-per-available-room (RevPAR) fell by nearly 90 % in the second quarter of 2020 and is forecasted to continuously decline due to travel bans and tourists’ fear of being stranded (Courtney, 2020). There is thus an urgent need for practical guiding frameworks that could assist the hotel sector in becoming more resilient during and after the pandemic.\n" +
                            "Although there exists a growing body of literature on crisis management, the current models tend to suggest a “one size fits all” approach, often overlooking the fact that crises vary largely in duration, scale and impacts (Speakman and Sharpley, 2012). Besides being more tourism-focused (as opposed to hospitality-focused), these models are also mainly conceptual, rarely tested empirically and do not propose practical strategies to address specific crisis such as a global pandemic (Ritchie and Jiang, 2019). This research note, therefore, seeks to initiate discussions towards the development of a more practical and refined pandemic crisis management framework for the hotel sector. Utilizing global news media sources, strategic responses of hotels are collected, analyzed and mapped out via an integrated strategic crisis management model (Ritchie, 2004; Wang and Ritchie, 2011). The note thus also makes practical contributions by identifying “strategic responses” that have been adopted by the hotel sector in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n"

                            "Nurses have been labelled “heroes” by politicians, the mass media, and the general public to describe their commitment to providing front-line care to people with COVID-19, despite the risks of exposure and lack of clinical resources. Few studies have examined the implications of the hero discourse to nurses’ professional, social, and political identities.\n" +
                            "Objective\n" +
                            "To critically examine the effects of the hero discourse on nurses who are contending with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and to consider the political, social, cultural, and professional impact of this discourse on nursing work.\n" +

                            "A poststructural discourse analysis, employing the theoretical ideas of truth, power, knowledge, subjectivity, and normalization, was conducted to explore the mass media’s constructions of nurse as hero in the contexts of COVID-19.

                            "Three main elements of the hero discourse include: 1. Nurses as a “necessary sacrifice” – portraying nurses as selfless, sacrificing, and outstanding moral subjects for practicing on the front-line without adequate protective gear and other clinical resources; 2. Nurses as “model citizens” – positioning nurses as compliant, hardworking, and obedient subjects in contrast to harmful individuals and groups that ignore or resist COVID-19 public health measures. 3. Heroism itself as the reward for nurses – characterizing hero worship as a fitting reward for nurses who were unappreciated pre-pandemic, as opposed to supporting long-term policy change, and highlighting how heroism reconfigures nursing work from the mundane and ordinary to the exciting and impactful.\n" +
                            "Conclusions\n" +
                            "The hero discourse is not a neutral expression of appreciation and sentimentality, but rather a tool employed to accomplish multiple aims such as the normalization of nurses’ exposure to risk, the enforcement of model citizenship, and the preservation of existing power relationships that limit the ability of front-line nurses to determine the conditions of their work. Our study has implications for approaching the collective political response of nursing in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and formalizing the ongoing emotional, psychological, ethical, and practice supports of nurses as the pandemic continues.\n"

                            "The wide and rapid spread of COVID-19 followed by the declaration of a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, forced residency training programs to adopt Declared Health Emergency (DHE) rotations. Under such a strategy, residents are divided into 2 groups. The first group is assigned to hospital duties (ie, direct patient care, rounding on inpatients, and covering urgent surgeries). At the same time, the second group is to stay home and participate in virtual learning. The goal of this restructuring has been to minimize exposure to both residents and patients, optimize the workforce to ensure maintenance of providing optimal patient care, and promote residents’ well-being.\n" +
                            "Our program curriculum restructuring was specifically designed within the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although part of the curriculum is directed toward disaster management and emergency preparedness, it did not lose focus on continuing surgical training in all 6 aspects of core competencies.\n" +

One group would be involved in the in-hospital patient surgical care and activities while participating in the group and department virtual activities. The second group does not participate in the in-hospital patient surgical care activities for that week. Instead, they participate in the Disaster and Emergency Preparedness (DMEP) curriculum, study/SIM laboratory training plan, and the department virtual meeting and group learning activities.\n"

                    "Activities within the sharing economy (SE) are in a precarious situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Even though the SE is considered a disruptive phenomenon, especially in the accommodation and transport sectors, the Covid-19 has raised concerns about its survivability. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, the value of SE firms has dropped, and many service providers have no other option but to stop working. Understanding the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the SE sector is therefore essential. The objective of this study is therefore to examine the effect of the Covid-19 on sharing economy activities. We have used various publications—such as news articles, TV news items, YouTube videos, and blog posts—as data sources for this study purpose. Through content analysis, the study shows how the SE phenomenon is coping with the changing environment caused by the Covid-19. We analyzed the SE sector mainly from the perspective of four stakeholders: SE firms, service providers, service receivers (customers), and regulatory bodies. We explored the SE phenomenon based mainly on the following themes: anxiety, cancelation, job loss, income reduction, hygiene and safety, overcoming strategy, and outcomes. Based on the findings, we point out implications and avenues for future research.\n" +

                            "The sharing economy (SE) has allowed travelers to organize their trips in new ways. They can book a room through Airbnb, travel in a car booked on Uber, eat food made by locals with EatWith, move around a city with a shared bike, and enjoy local attractions with Vayable (Heo, 2016; Zhou et al., 2020), all at a lower price than they would conventionally pay (Hossain, 2020). Forecasts indicate that the global SE market is expected to grow from US$15 billion in 2015 to US$335 billion in 2025 (Narasimhan et al., 2018). However, the Covid-19 has radically affected the SE. While few businesses have avoided the unprecedented disruptions of the pandemic (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020), the SE sector has been particularly affected (Zenker and Kock, 2020) since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. However, the importance of sharing is gaining growing attention in the Covid-19 era (Mont et al., 2020), because many sectors, such as healthcare tourism (Kumar et al., 2020) and restaurants (Camilleri and Neuhofer, 2017) are closely related to the SE, especially in bigger cities. The Covid-19 encourages firms to embrace openness in sharing information (Chesbrough, 2020).\n" +
                            "The SE is defined as “people coordinating the acquisition and distribution of a resource for a fee or other compensation” (Belk, 2014, p. 1597). Many economic, social, and technological factors have positioned the SE as a promising phenomenon (Mody et al., 2019). There are numerous sorts of SE activities, and grouping them under a single category would be unproductive (Hagiu and Wright, 2019). The SE focuses on serving underutilized resources, thus promoting efficiency, community, and sustainability (Cheng et al., 2020; Geissinger et al., 2019), with the latter being a key concern for businesses (Muduli et al., 2020). Whether service providers—such as Uber drivers, Uber Eats delivery agents, and Airbnb hosts—should be considered employees, contractors, or workers is under serious debate. Sharing platforms consider service providers (e.g., Uber drivers and AirBnB hosts) as contractors, thus offloading the responsibility for insurance and social benefits (Hossain, 2020).\n"

Further, we test which of the learning methods (traditional, online, and hybrid) is preferred by Romanian students in economics in this unusual context. Using a sample of 1415 students from five major Romanian faculties of economics and applying ordinal and bivariate logit regressions models, we found that psychological distress and increased concerns about COVID-19 pandemic have a negative effect on learning effectiveness. Also, our results revealed that the students who face problems related to unsatisfactory internet access, insufficient time due to other familial issues, who have inadequate working space at home and also the male ones are more likely to be less effective in their online learning process. Finally, the university infrastructure for online activities decreases the likelihood that students will perceive online studies as less effective.\n" +
                            "۱٫ Introduction\n" +
                            "Any online learning environment is considered to be a framework that “uses the Internet to deliver some form of instruction to learners separated by time, distance, or both” (Dempsey and Van Eck, 2002, p. 283). At the institutional level, eLearning in exceptional times, such as the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, should be seen as a backup educational system to continue the learning process. This kind of pandemic has spread almost all over the world, although it was not until December 2019 that the first official case in China was confirmed and hospitalized (Huang et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the situation has escalated so much due to the coronavirus outbreak that led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Lai et al., 2020) (Figs. 1 and 2).\n" +
                            "The impossibility to predict the stopping of this pandemic leaves room for numerous scenarios related to the lack of predictability. This status quo generates extremely much uncertainty and confusion that affect the economic, social and political institutions, also the interpersonal connection. All these changes have tremendous effects on humans and their relationships with other people and with institutions. When it comes to the educational issue, the unexpected health crisis made, on 15th of May 2020, more than 1.2 billion learners, about 70 percent of total enrolled ones, from 158 countries, to be highly affected by the global lockdown (UNESCO, 2020a). Hundreds of million students worldwide were and still are affected by “social distancing” or “self-isolation” measures promoted by their countries’ governments, because of the impossibility to attend physical classes which may influence their school performance (UNESCO, 2020a). Especially in the case when those students don’t have the proper infrastructure for online learning, it is obvious that their grades are critically marked. Also, homeschooling hurts the parents’ mobility, performance at work and, overall, on economic productivity of firms (UNESCO, 2020b). The same previous report emphasizes that a low level of familial wealth, reduces the level of democratization of access to technology, due to the difficulty to establish an internet connection, is a powerful barrier towards eLearning and a major source for exclusion, isolation and inequality.\n"

                            "Since the global outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), plastic surgeons were forced to transition from traditional didactics to virtual lectures to practice “social distancing.” As this method of education continues to be widely used, understanding the current trend of its usage is critical. In this study, we performed a survey study of virtual lecture attendees and presenters to determine current usage and general consensus on virtual lectures in plastic surgery education.\n" +
                            "Methods\n" +
                            "An electronic survey was sent to attendees and presenters of virtual lectures using Google Forms. Demographic data, webinar usage patterns, and views on virtual lectures were collected.\n" +
                            "Results\n" +
                            "A total of 417 surveys were received. Prior to the COVID-19 era, 39.1percent of attendees did not use virtual lectures and 45.6percent of presenters did not give webinars at all. Both groups reported that the lack of opportunities and need were the most common cause of no use of lectures or webinars. After the outbreak, 35.4percent of attendees now use virtual lectures daily and 51.4percent of presenters give lectures weekly. Over 90percent of the study population reported a positive experience with the virtual lectures due to increased interaction, convenience, outreach, and usability. Finally, over 75percent stated that virtual lectures might replace classroom lectures in the future.\n" +
                            "Conclusion\n" +
                            "Our study shows that a majority of plastic surgeons have begun to use and give virtual lectures daily after the COVID-19 outbreak. Virtual education is a powerful and versatile tool that has great potentials, and it may continue to serve as a part of surgical training in the future.\n" +

                            "On December 2019 at Wuhan, Hubei province, China, what is now known as the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started.1 The virus rapidly spread around the globe, inflicting up to 2.2 million people by mid-April of 2020.2 COVID-19 is known to spread from person to person, and it can remain on the surface of plastics for up to 72 h. 3,4 Because of its high transmission rate, governments across the globe executed orders to ban leaving the home for anything other than essential activities such as grocery shopping.5 Plastic surgeons have stopped any elective surgeries to preserve personal protective equipment and joined the fight against the COVID-19 by taking care of critically ill patients at the Intensive Care Units.6\n" +
                            "As the COVID-19 outbreak continued, the question of how to continue plastic surgery education during the outbreak arose. Plastic surgery trainees at North America traditionally attend classroom didactics, followed by online modules on the American Society Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) Education Network (EdNet).7, 8, 9 In addition, trainees have visiting professors to participate in hands on courses and attend national conferences.7 In contrast, offline learning maybe limited to countries without an established plastic surgery community and resources to train a large number of residents. In these countries, online platforms such as social media and online community are widely used to seek guidance and learn from the experts online.10, 11, 12, 13\n"

                            "Healthcare workers (HCWs) are deemed to be at high risk of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a potential risk of transmission to vulnerable patients (Keeley et al., 2020, Galmiche et al., 2020). In Japan, Furuse et al. have shown that 30% of clusters identified in reported Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases are linked to healthcare facilities (Furuse et al., 2020). Hospitals have initiated infection control measures to protect HCWs, ensure workforce availability, and decrease in-hospital transmission risk. The Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) university hospitals group is the largest public hospital system in Europe with 39 centres and 100,000 employees serving 8.3 million patients through a 20 000-bed capacity. In France, when the first patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 arrived from China and Italy in February 2020, AP-HP decided to prioritise testing COVID-19 for individuals suffering from unknown and severe pneumonia and organise a screening consultation for symptomatic HCWs. It was estimated that approximately 500 HCWs had been already infected at the AP-HP before the first lockdown in mid-March 2020. Along with standard precautions, droplet precautions for routine care and using personal protective equipment (PPE) such as wearing a medical mask, medical glasses or a face shield and overcoat, were implemented (Société française d’Hygiène Hospitalière, 2020).\n"

For the present study, descriptive method is used. The sample of 181 private school teachers was drawn using a purposive sampling procedure. The organizational commitment questionnaire is developed by Allen and Meyer in 1990 and job satisfaction index by Brayfield and Rothe in 1951 is used for the study. For descriptive statistics mean, standard deviation (S.D.), and z test is used. Shapiro–Wilks test, Levene’s test, and Mann–Whitney U test is used to analyze data in the current study. The results revealed that female teachers are more continuance committed as compared to male teachers during this tough situation of a pandemic. The level of organizational commitment is found low in both female and male teachers during the Covid-19. No significant difference is found in the overall job satisfaction among male and female teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study also determines a positive and significant relationship between organizational commitment and job satisfaction during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n" +

                            "Today the industry setup is shifting in relation to the worldwide epidemic of Covid-19. Organizational commitment in the workplace is the connection of an employee’s involvement with their organization. Individuals who are committed to their organization usually feel an association with their organization. Individuals feel that they fit in the organization and also feel they recognize the objectives of the organization. Committed employees are always tending to be more determined in their work and they show quite high efficiency and productivity. Organizational commitment explains the involvement of an employee with a particular organization. Organizational commitment is characterized by three factors, that is, belief in the organization and acceptance of the goals and values of the organization; readiness to employ considerable effort; and a positive aspiration to continue with the organization (Porter et al., 1974). An organizational commitment means a psychological state that attaches the individual to their organization. Organizational commitments have three labels, that is, affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment. All the three constructs are linked to turnover (Allen & Meyer, 1990). Thus, organizational commitment is related to the employee involvement and attachment to the organization. If they are not committed to their organization, they will leave the organization. So this concept is also related to turnover. The model of organizational commitment explains that commitment to an organization is a psychological state, and that it has three dimensions, that is, affective, normative, and continuance commitment that affect how employees feel about the organization that they work for (Meyer & Allen, 1997).\n"

                    "This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic has forced Flemish growth-oriented entrepreneurs to build entrepreneurial resilience. We rely on a research framework that consists of a “challenge-reaction-learning loop” to empirically investigate how entrepreneurial resilience is built in times of the COVID-19 crisis. To investigate this complex entrepreneurial learning process, we use data that have been collected during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. By using several datapoints, we could identify (1) the specific challenges growth-oriented firms are facing as a result of the COVID-19 crisis; (2) how these entrepreneurs reacted to these challenges; and (3) what they learned during the first and second wave of the pandemic and how they perceive the future. By making this entrepreneurial learning process explicit and dividing it into an iterative “challenge-reaction-learning loop”, this study is relevant for all entrepreneurs, as it contains several interesting lessons learned. We also contribute to academic literature as we provide future researchers a tangible framework to further elucidate how entrepreneurial resilience is built in times of crisis.\n" +

Research to date has mainly focused on previous economic crises like the dot-com crash, e.g., [1,2]; the 2008 financial crisis, e.g., [3–۶]; and natural disasters, e.g., [7,8] to investigate the impact of an economic crisis on entrepreneurs and their businesses. Although these studies have highly increased our general understanding of entrepreneurial best practices during and after an economic crisis, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis we are currently facing is of an entirely different order and its impact on entrepreneurship remains to be studied.\n"

Specifically, the risks of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 raised the fear about one’s own health and the health of their families. Besides, the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic pushed many individuals to the brink of joblessness, which could be psychologically devastating to them [1, 2]. In the USA, it is documented that as the pandemic severity proxied by the mortality rate is negatively associated with public mental health [3]. Compared to the Chinese, Americans tend to report more stress and depressive symptoms, which could potentially be attributed to their high number of infected healthcare workers, the lack of personal protective equipment, and the risk of losing health insurance tied to their employment [4]. In order to resolve the COVID-19 pandemic, attempts to produce vaccines have been made since early 2020 and the US Congress set aside billions of dollars for this purpose [5]. As a result, two series of vaccines, the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, were successfully developed and granted emergency use authorization in December 2020. Mass vaccination in the USA immediately began in late 2020. ‘is study evaluates the extent to which COVID-19 vaccination affects public mental health in the context of the USA. ‘e study makes two contributions to the literature. First, I analyze the less tangible impacts of COVID-19 vaccination, particularly, the impact on mental health, whereas other studies tend to concentrate on the visible impacts such as those on infection, hospitalization, and death. By doing so, this study provides additional scientific evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related interventions and public welfare."

The study has delineated a systematic mapping of the retail ecosystem’s reactions to the COVID-19 shock. Three overarching dimensions related to consumers’ online purchasing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic were identified: triggers of enhanced digital engagement, transformative capacity of digital technologies, and socio-economic adaptability during crises. The relevant themes underlying each aggregate dimension were further elaborated with evidence from the interviews. The study findings advance the extant literature on purchasing behavior and online retailing in times of crisis and offer important practical implications on improving crisis management capabilities of the retail ecosystem via digital technologies.

Information and communication technologies (ICTs), online marketing platforms and sophisticated digital devices have advanced exponentially, supporting the growth of various economic sectors (Zhu, 2021). Specifically, in the retail sector, various digital technologies support multichannel strategies or even an omni-channel approach, which offer consumers a range of alternatives in purchasing goods and services (Jin & Shin, 2020). Mobile devices, mobile apps, augmented reality and virtual reality applications, and various types of bots have already been in service instead of or combined with traditional human-to-human interactions – in either physical, online or hybrid offline/online settings – to serve customers’ needs and retailers’ goals (Hu & Tracogna, 2020; Verhoef et al., 2015).\n" +

This research aims to identify problems of the “learning from home” policy in kindergarten education and formulate possible solutions to overcome them. It involved 15 respondents from different regions in Indonesia. Data were collected through several methods, including face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, and online interviews through messaging services. The research result showed that many kindergarten management boards encountered difficulties in fulfilling planned education schedules and had the low achievement of objective targets. The problems existed in teachers, parents, and mainly students. Most teachers faced problems in creating interactive education materials and conducting an evaluation. Parents had hard times in assisting their children due to their busy activities and low pedagogical competence. Children had hard times due to limited resources for online learning. This research suggests solutions such as improving the mastery of information and communication technology (ICT), especially for teachers, parents, and children. However, the education system’s long-term reform is needed to prepare for facing the possible catastrophe that affects the education system.

There is mounting evidence that it can also be transmitted by inhalation of infected saliva aerosol particles. These particles are generated when breathing, talking, laughing, coughing or sneezing. It can be assumed that aerosol particle concentrations should be kept low in order to minimize the potential risk of airborne virus transmission. This paper presents measurements of aerosol particle concentrations in a gym, where saliva aerosol production is pronounced. 35 test persons performed physical exercise and aerosol particle concentrations, CO2 concentrations, air temperature and relative humidity were obtained in the room of 886 m³. A separate test was used to discriminate between human endogenous and exogenous aerosol particles. Aerosol particle removal by mechanical ventilation and mobile air cleaning units was measured. The gym test showed that ventilation with air-change rate ACH = 2.2 h−۱, i.e. 4.5 times the minimum of the Dutch Building Code, was insufficient to stop the significant aerosol concentration rise over 30 min. Air cleaning alone with ACH = 1.39 h−۱ had a similar effect as ventilation alone. Simplified mathematical models were engaged to provide further insight into ventilation, air cleaning and deposition. It was shown that combining the above-mentioned ventilation and air cleaning can reduce aerosol particle concentrations with 80 to 90% , depending on aerosol size. This combination of existing ventilation supplemented with air cleaning is energy efficient and can also be applied for other indoor environments.\n" +

It has been suggested that this virus can be transmitted by respiratory droplets and by contact routes [2–۷]. Direct transmission can occur when infective droplets produced by activities such as talking, laughing, coughing or sneezing reach the mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) of another person. Indirect or contact route transmission can occur via handrails, keyboard buttons and other objects, where virus is deposited after contact with an infected person. There is mounting evidence that the virus can also be transmitted by inhalation of saliva aerosol particles because the virus has been found in small aerosol particles that can remain in the air for hours, and it has been shown to maintain viability in such aerosols [8–۱۲]. Therefore, precautionary measures should not only be applied for the direct transmission route and the contact route, but also for the airborne route.\n"

From an analysis of 81 studies, we identified five overarching public health themes concerning the role of online social media platforms and COVID-19. These themes focused on: surveying public attitudes, identifying infodemics, assessing mental health, detecting or predicting COVID-19 cases, analysing government responses to the pandemic, and evaluating quality of health information in prevention education videos. Furthermore, our Review emphasises the paucity of studies on the application of machine learning on data from COVID-19-related social media and a scarcity of studies documenting real-time surveillance that was developed with data from social media on COVID-19.

                            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the resulting COVID-19, is a substantial international public health issue. As of Jan 18, 2021, an estimated 95 million people worldwide had been infected with the virus, with about 2 million deaths.1 As a consequence of the pandemic, social media is becoming the platform of choice for public opinions, perceptions, and attitudes towards various events or public health policies regarding COVID-19.2 Social media has become a pivotal communication tool for governments, organisations, and universities to disseminate crucial information to the public. Numerous studies have already used social media data to help to identify and detect outbreaks of infectious diseases and to interpret public attitudes, behaviours, and perceptions.3,  ۴,  ۵,  ۶ Social media, particularly Twitter, can be used to explore multiple facets of public health research. A systematic review identified six categories of Twitter use for health research, namely content analysis, surveillance, engagement, recruitment, as part of an intervention, and network analysis of Twitter users.5 However, this review included only broader research terms, such as health, medicine, or disease, by use of Twitter data and did not focus on specific disease topics, such as COVID-19. Another article analysed tweets on COVID-19 and identified 12 topics that were categorised into four main themes: the origin, source, effects on individuals and countries, and methods of decreasing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.7 In this study, data were not available for tweets that were related to COVID-19 before February, 2020, thereby missing the initial part of the epidemic, and the data for tweets were limited to between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020.\n" +
                            "Social media can also be effectively used to communicate health information to the general public during a pandemic. Emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, almost always result in increased usage and consumption of media of all forms by the general public for information.8 Therefore, social media has a crucial role in people’s perception of disease exposure, resultant decision making, and risk behaviours.9,  ۱۰ As information on social media is generated by users, such information can be subjective or inaccurate, and frequently includes misinformation and conspiracy theories.11 Hence, it is imperative that accurate and timely information is disseminated to the general public about emerging threats, such as SARS-CoV-2. A systematic review explored the major approaches that were used in published research on social media and emerging infectious diseases.12 The review identified three major approaches: assessment of the public’s interest in, and responses to, emerging infectious diseases; examination of organisations’ use of social media in communicating emerging infectious diseases; and evaluation of the accuracy of medical information that is related to emerging infectious diseases on social media. However, this review did not focus on studies that used social media data to track and predict outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.\n"

                    "Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in unprecedented time. However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated.

                            "Methods\n" +
                            "In November 2020, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 U.S. adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Participants reported being willing, undecided, and unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19 across 13 assessments conducted from April to October 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against COVID-19 were also assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale.\n" +
                            "Results\n" +
                            "Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the proportion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RR=2.47, 95% CI=2.04, 3.00; unwilling: RR=1.92, 95% CI=1.67, 2.20), Black participants (undecided: RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.73, 2.74; unwilling: RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63, 2.42), and female participants (undecided: RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.20, 1.65; unwilling: RR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14, 1.46). Participants who were older or were on higher incomes were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common.\n" +

However, the overall effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated, at least in part, by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. Simulation studies suggest that at least three quarters of the population may need to be vaccinated to extinguish the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.4,5\n" +
                            "During the early stages of the pandemic (March–June), studies of small samples of European and Australian adults suggested that the majority of surveyed people reported that they would be vaccinated when a widely available vaccine was available.6,7 Similarly, a nationally representative study of adults in China conducted in March found that 9 in 10 persons would accept a vaccine when available.8 U.S. studies conducted early in the pandemic found that between 58% and 86% of adults reported that they were likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19.6,9, 10, 11\n"

Subjects and methods: One hundred and thirty-one adults participated in the study. Measurement tools included the Body Image Quality of Life Inventory, the short form of the Situational Inventory of Body-Image Dysphoria, the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Contour Drawing Scale. Results: The effects of body image-related negative emotions or depression on body dissatisfaction is moderated by body image-related quality of life, but only among obese participants.

                            "Obesity is a health problem of global dimensions that demands interdisciplinary solutions (Burlandy et al., 2020; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020). Being obese may be associated with serious difficulties in mental functioning (Hemmingsson, 2014; Marks, 2015; Raman et al., 2020). Numerous studies (on the period before COVID-19) show that obese people are characterized by worse emotional functioning and have a more negative body image and lower quality of life, as well as a higher level of depression than people with normal body weight (e.g. Kass et al., 2019; Pimenta et al., 2015; Sarigiani et al., 2020; Weinberger et al., 2016). Moreover, obese people are at high risk of complications from developing COVID-19 (e.g. Wadman, 2020; World Obesity, 2021). With regard to mental health, many authors indicate that the epidemiological situation related to COVID-19 significantly disrupts mental functioning (including the quality of life, emotional functioning and body image) (e. g. Aksoy & Koçak, 2020; Bryson, 2020; Carbone, 2020; Fitzpatrick, 2020; Jakovljevic et al., 2020; Kamberi et al., 2020; Nurunnabi et al., 2021; Samlani et al., 2020; Shek, 2021; Swami et al., 2021).\n"

In order to study the shock effect of the COVID-19 on the market financial system, this paper builds a data model processing system based on the event analysis method, and analyzes the shock effect from three aspects of supply chain finance, financial securities, and corporate financial systems. Moreover, this paper uses crawler technology to obtain valid data from major websites, analyzes model data with mathematical statistics combined with event models, and outputs the results and compares them with the actual situation. Through data analysis, it can be seen that the model constructed in this paper can effectively reflect the shock effect of the COVID-19 on the market financial system. Finally, the comparison method is used to compare the research results with the actual situation. The results show that the two are basically the same.

Although China has controlled the deterioration of the epidemic, this global epidemic will inevitably have an impact on the global economy including China. At present, the epidemic abroad has spread significantly. As governments of various countries have adopted measures to close the country, states, and cities, production factors cannot flow freely in the market, and many industries around the world have been hit hard. Moreover, many companies are unable to carry out normal production, the global industrial chain is broken, and global market demand is in a declining stage. In addition, the global stock market plummeted, and many countries including the United States, South Korea, and the Philippines experienced stock market circuit breakers.

It is revealed that the Nepalese academia has been facing problems due to lack of adequate and appropriate sustainable infrastructure for the online system, including skilled human resources. In addition, limited internet facilities in remote and rural areas were the other challenging tasks for virtual academic activities. Therefore, the concerned stakeholders should provide necessary services and appropriate strategies for virtual means of the education system to compensate the repercussion caused by the pandemic.

The global health emergency due to COVID-19 was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30th January 2020. Subsequently, it was declared a pandemic after more than 118,000 infected population by COVID-19 from 114 countries with 4,291 deaths up to 11th March 2020.

Among the different prevention strategies, the lockdown was considered as one of the best approaches for interrupting transmission, which was widely adopted by the global community (Flaxman et al., 2020). Therefore, many of the countries in the world imposed lockdown throughout the national and regional levels. In the same line, the Government of Nepal (GoN) also announced the first lockdown on 24th March 2020 and continued for about six months (Basnet et al., 2021a, Basnet et al., 2021b). Besides the lockdown, effective tracking, tracing, quarantine, social distancing, and hygienic behaviours of some countries such as China controlled the disease spread successfully (Basnet et al., 2021c).

In Wuhan, China, a new virus (COVID-19) was detected in December 2019. The COVID-19 has spread throughout China and the rest of the world [2, 3]. Coronaviruses are highly contagious and rapidly transferred from person to person. The disease, which is now a global pandemic, has spread swiftly around the world, causing severe public health issues as well as an economic crisis. When unpredictable infectious diseases arise, causing an outbreak leads to an epidemic and eventually results in a pandemic [4]. Researchers attempt to use modelling techniques to explain the observable trends and predict specific patterns in the future so that health practitioners can organize health care programs, and their responses can be planned to mitigate such situations [4, 5]. Wangari et al. [6] noted that epidemiological models are becoming increasingly useful for understanding the complex processes regulating infectious disease transmission.\n" +

Scientists are putting in measures by actively conducting empirical studies to make relevant decisions concerning COVID-19 that may end the pandemic. Anjorin Hindawi Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine Volume 2022, Article ID 3163854, 17 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3163854 [8] reported that the risk to global public health, including the extreme acute threat in 2002, is an outbreak of respiratory syndrome (SARS) that caused 800 deaths with approximately 8000 reported cases. Emerging infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity and cause many deaths, which reduce the world population drastically. According to estimates, the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 killed 18500 people; 800 people out of 2500 cases in 2012 died from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [8, 9]. Ebola outbreak killed 11310 people out of 28616 cases in 2014, and the latest coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has killed more than 2.43 million people out of 110 million reported cases [8, 9]. This research focuses on four countries (United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and Nigeria). The reason for selecting these countries was because, according to a report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these countries recorded the first recorded cases of the SARS-CoV-2 new variant [10]. The ending section of the year 2020 saw many countries around the globe recording different forms of SARS-CoV-2. According to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in December 2020, several SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating worldwide [10].\n"

According to the S.I.R. model (Susceptible Infectious Recovered Model), the epidemic includes 5 phases: the normal phase, the incubation phase of the epidemic, the outbreak phase, the post-epidemic phase, and the recovery and improvement phase (Ye et al., 2020). The normal phase is a phase when there is no pandemic to create interference; during these normal times, people in the cities of China usually travel by public transit. During the incubation phase, a small number of infected people appear, but the infection has not spread. During the outbreak phase, the number of infected people increases rapidly, and the risk of cross-infection increases rapidly. In the post-epidemic phase, the number of newly infected people gradually decrease, and the number of existing infected people declines. In the recovery and improvement phase, the epidemic is controlled, but it is difficult to determine whether there are still asymptomatic infections.

                    "The objective of the present study was to explore possible changes in the psychological wellbeing of young healthy students during the initial 14 days of the COVID-19 general lockdown that occurred in March of 2020, and if there was any relation with specific personality traits (neuroticism, psychoticism, and extraversion), cognitive styles (internal and external locus of control and intolerance of uncertainty), and coping strategies. One hundred twenty-two university students aged from 18 to 29 years participated in the study. The dispositional factors were assessed at the beginning of the study, while measures of psychological adjustment (anxiety, depression, and self-perceived health) were taken in three different assessment stages, employing validated questionnaires and scales. Anxiety and depression scores significantly increased after one week of lockdown, reaching a plateau pattern by the second week. The levels of self-perceived mental health, vitality, and quality of life showed a pattern of sustained progressive decrease, with a more acute lessening during the first week. Neuroticism, intolerance of uncertainty, and negative autofocus were associated to worse levels of psychological adjustment. These individual differences might be taken into consideration when designing prevention programs aiming to dampen the psychological impact of a general lockdown in healthy population.\n" +

                            "COVID-19 has been considered to have a higher incidence in elderly people, and the increased risk of mortality in hospital has been unquestionably associated with advanced age [1,2]. Nevertheless, youngsters have also been struck by the effects of the pandemic and the associated social restrictions, especially regarding daily life activities and routines. This unexpected changes might have an impact on the wellbeing and mental health levels of otherwise healthy subjects [3–۵]. In Spain, the restraints initially consisted of a two-week general lockdown proclaimed under a state of emergency and ordained on 14 March 2020, with the explicit prohibition of abandoning the residence for any other reason than acquiring basic supplies (food and medicaments). With the aim of protecting the health of the population against a fast spread of the COVID-19 and to stop the sharp rise in the number of deaths, the lockdown lasted almost three months and further included the closure of schools, universities, and non-essential industries, offices, and shops [6]. Subjecting the population to such a heavy social constraint could have had undesired consequences for the mental health of the individuals [7].\n"

                            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a global pandemic, and to prevent the spread of the virus, authorities imposed restrictive measures in many countries. Italy was the first European country to impose such measures (Government, 2020). Everyone was banned from leaving home except for approved reasons. This measure forced children to follow distance learning guidelines and forced parents to work remotely. Moreover, since most businesses were closed, many people lost their jobs or suffered a severe loss of income (Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, & Fasolo, 2020). In the family environment, the educational role of parents became much more crucial than it was before. All educational services were closed, babysitters and grandparents were not allowed to provide support, and contacts with peers were not allowed. Children could rely only on their parents, who then served as teachers, educators and playmates. Many parents also had to start working from home, and balance time and spaces while having to work with children nearby can be very challenging. Indeed, due to the absence of other educative and supportive figures, parents inherited the role of promoting positive development and new learning experiences for their children (Wang, 2020).\n" +
                            "This plight was even more challenging for families and children with developmental disabilities (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Hume et al., 2020). One specific and broad subgroup of these families and children are children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The latest revision of DSM American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) adopted the umbrella term “autism spectrum disorder” with two features: difficulties in social communication and social interaction and restricted and repetitive behaviour, interests or activities. Together with the core symptoms, cooccurring psychiatric or neurological disorders and intellectual disabilities are common in children with autism. These two sets of symptoms have a wide range of severity levels, which may be different for each child with ASD (Lord et al., 2020).\n"

                    "Available online xxxx Ferritin is a known inflammatory biomarker in COVID-19. However, many factors and co-morbidities can confound the level of serum ferritin. This current metaanalysis evaluates serum ferritin level in different severity levels in COVID-19. Studies evaluating serum ferritin level in different clinical contexts (COVID-19 vs. control, mild to moderate vs. severe to critical, non-survivor vs. survivor, organ involvement, ICU and mechanical ventilation requirement) were included (total 9 literature databases searched). Metaanalysis and metaregression was carried out using metaphor “R” package. Compared to control (COVID-19 negative), higher ferritin levels were found among the COVID-19 patients [SMD −۰٫۸۸۹ (۹۵% C.I. −۱٫۲۰۱, −۰٫۵۷۷), I2 = 85%]. Severe to critical COVID-19 patients showed higher ferritin levels compared to mild to moderate COVID-19 patients [SMD 0.882 (0.738, 1.026), I2 = 85%]. In meta-regression, high heterogeneity was observed could be attributed to difference in “mean age”, and “percentage of population with concomitant co-morbidities”. Non-survivors had higher serum ferritin level compared to survivors [SMD 0.992 (0.672, 1.172), I2 = 92.33%]. In meta-regression, high heterogeneity observed could be attributed to difference in “mean age” and “percentage of male sex”. Patients requiring ICU [SMD 0.674 (0.515 to 0.833), I2 = 80%] and mechanical ventilation [SMD 0.430 (0.258, 0.602), I 2 = 32%] had higher serum ferritin levels compared to those who didn’t. To conclude, serum ferritin level may serve as an important biomarker which can aid in COVID-19 management. However, presence of other co-morbid conditions/confounders warrants cautious interpretation.\n" +

                            "Human ferritin is composed of two subunits, namely ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and ferritin light chain (FTL) [1]. The FTH chain has ferroxidase activity and oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+. Fe3+ then moves towards the nucleation site on the FTL chain and thus by acting in a synchronizing way, iron oxidation and core formation is carried out [2]. The ferritin units assemble in the form of a sphere with a cage inside it, the outer and inner diameter of which is 12 and 8 nm respectively. This nano-cage (stable at pH range 3 to 9) separates iron in the core from the outside environment and thus protects the body from harmful effects of excess free iron [2]. One ferritin molecule can store upto 5000 iron atoms [2].\n"

                    "Objectives: : We examined the association between social frailty and depressive symptoms among communitydwelling older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Additionally, we investigated whether home exercise habits moderated the impact of social frailty on depressive symptoms. Methods: : This cross-sectional study included 1,103 community-dwelling older adults (54.0% female, mean age [standard deviation] = 81.1 [5.0] years) from a semi-urban area of Japan who completed a mailed questionnaire survey in October 2020. Social frailty status was categorized as non-social frailty, pre-social frailty, and social frailty, which was assessed by financial difficulties, living alone, lack of social activity, and contact with neighbors. Depressive symptoms were defined as a Kessler 6 score ≥۵٫ We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the association between social frailty and depressive symptoms, and also conducted stratified analysis of home exercise habits during the pandemic. Results: : A total of 309 (28.0%) participants had depressive symptoms. Compared with non-social frailty, social frailty was associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 1.16–۲٫۷۹, p = 0.009). A similar relationship was observed in those who did not exercise at home (OR = 2.10, 95%CI = 1.14–۳٫۸۴, p =0.017). However, no such relationship was observed in those who did exercise at home (OR = 1.50, 95%CI = 0.79–۲٫۸۵, p =0.213). Conclusions: : Social frailty was associated with a risk of depressive symptoms during the pandemic. In addition, our findings suggested that home exercise may buffer the association between social frailty and depressive symptoms.\n" +

The World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). Owing to the insufficient establishment of effective pharmacological interventions, COVID-19 management depends on public health measures to mitigate its spread and flatten the pandemic curve. These measures include bans on public gatherings, stay-at-home policies, and physical distancing strategies(Hartley & Perencevich, 2020). In Japan, a state of emergency was issued by the government on April 7, 2020, calling for restrictions on interactions between citizens and refraining from social interactions (lifted on May 31, 2020) (Karako, Song, Chen, Tang, & Kokudo, 2021; Looi, 2020). Some prefectures declared a local prefectural-level state of emergency in late July 2020, corresponding to the second wave. This involved self-restraint when dining at restaurants at night (lifted in early September 2020) (Gifu Prefectural Office, 2020; Karako et al., 2021).\n"

Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of latent psychopathology vulnerabilities, often activated by environmental stressors. The present study examined COVID19′ s impact on adolescent depression and possible influences of different domains of social connectedness (loneliness, social media use, social video game time, degree of social activity participation). Methods: A community sample of 175 adolescents (51% boys, mean age = 16.01 years) completed questionnaires once before and twice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Piecewise growth modeling examined the acute (7 weeks) and persistent (8 months) effects of COVID-19 on depressive symptoms, and differences across sex and social connectedness. Results: Significant increases in depressive symptoms followed pandemic onset for boys and girls. However, this increase was earlier and more pronounced among girls than boys, whose depression only increased significantly during the persistent period and to a lesser degree. Trajectories of depression were influenced by loneliness and social connections. Limitations: Most participants had economic stability and minimal exposure to the virus. Exacerbation of depressive symptoms may be more severe in higher risk populations. Conclusions: Adolescent depression levels have increased during COVID-19, and are higher for girls and those who are lonely. Enhanced screening and management for adolescent depression and social connectedness could play a critical role in mitigating the negative mental health fallout of COVID-19 and future pandemics within this population.\n" +

Aquaculture plays a vital and rapidly expanding role in food security, in some cases overtaking wild caught fisheries in the production of high-quality animal protein in this PFSC. We performed a rapid global assessment to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related emerging control measures on the aquaculture supply chain. Socio-economic effects of the pandemic were analysed by surveying the perceptions of stakeholders, who were asked to describe potential supply-side disruption, vulnerabilities and resilience patterns along the production pipeline with four main supply chain components: a) hatchery, b) production/processing, c) distribution/logistics and d) market. We also assessed different farming strategies, comparing land- vs. sea-based systems; extensive vs. intensive methods; and with and without integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, IMTA. In addition to evaluating levels and sources of economic distress, interviewees were asked to identify mitigation solutions adopted at local / internal (i.e., farm-site) scales, and to express their preference on national / external scale mitigation measures among a set of a priori options. Survey responses identified the potential causes of disruption, ripple effects, sources of food insecurity, and socio-economic conflicts. They also pointed to various levels of mitigation strategies. The collated evidence represents a first baseline useful to address future disaster-driven responses, to reinforce the resilience of the sector and to facilitate the design reconstruction plans and mitigation measures, such as financial aid strategies.\n" +

In this paper, we report on the generation of the receptor-binding domain RBD203-N1 yeast expression construct, which produces a recombinant protein capable of eliciting a robust immune response and protection in mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge infections. The RBD203-N1 antigen was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris X33. After fermentation at the 5 L scale, the protein was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was characterized biophysically and biochemically, and after its formulation, the immunogenicity was evaluated in mice. Sera were evaluated for their efficacy using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay. The RBD203-N1 protein was expressed with a yield of 492.9 ± ۳٫۰ mg/L of fermentation supernatant. A two-step purification process produced a >96% pure protein with a recovery rate of 55 ± ۳% (total yield of purified protein: 270.5 ± ۱۳٫۲ mg/L fermentation supernatant). The protein was characterized to be a homogeneous monomer that showed a well-defined secondary structure, was thermally stable, antigenic, and when adjuvanted on Alhydrogel in the presence of CpG it was immunogenic and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The characteristics of the RBD203-N1 proteinbased vaccine show that this candidate is another well suited RBD-based construct for technology transfer to manufacturing entities and feasibility of transition into the clinic to evaluate its immunogenicity and safety in humans.\n" +

                            "The physical limitations imposed on fourth year medical students and residency programs by the COVID-19 pandemic have created new challenges in an increasingly competitive general surgery residency application process.1,2 In 2014e2015, well over half of fourth year medical students completed an away rotation.3 The Coalition of Physician Accountability, which the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) is a member of, recommended the immediate suspension of in-person visiting rotations and interviews for the 2020e2021 application cycle in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.4 Alterations to the 2021 match process and outcomes are anticipated due to the abrupt decrease of inperson opportunities. The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has forced general surgery residency programs to shift to a novel form of interviews by way of virtual interaction.5e9 This contrasts traditional in-person evaluations which allowed programs to directly assess an applicant’s interpersonal skills and interactions with faculty and house staff.10,11 For applicants, the traditional interview played a significant role on the order of the rank list as it allowed for applicants to evaluate important factors such as a program’s fit, location, and character.\n" +

We hypothesize that there has been, and will continue to be, a sharp increase in all forms of social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) secondary to strict physical barriers imposed on prospective applicants and residency programs. Herein, we explain the extent of this virtual transition among general surgery residencies by evaluating their social media presence on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, advertisement of virtual open house opportunities, and offerings of virtual sub-internships to prospective applicants.\n"

                    "In this study, we examine the hedging relationship between gold and US sectoral stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. We employ a multivariate volatility framework, which accounts for salient features of the series in the computation of optimal weights and optimal hedging ratios. We find evidence of hedging effectiveness between gold and sectoral stocks, albeit with lower performance, during the pandemic. Overall, including gold in a stock portfolio could provide a valuable asset class that can improve the risk-adjusted performance of stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we find that the estimated portfolio weights and hedge ratios are sensitive to structural breaks, and ignoring the breaks can lead to overestimation of the hedging effectiveness of gold for US sectoral stocks. Since the analysis involves sectoral stock data, we believe that any investor in the US stock market that seeks to maximize risk-adjusted returns is likely to find the results useful when making investment decisions during the pandemic.\n" +

                            "The literature on the response of financial markets, including the stock market, to the COVID-19 pandemic is fast growing, owing to its grave consequences. Several studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on financial markets (see for example, Ali et al., 2020; Al-Awadhi et al., 2020; Baig et al., 2020; Haroon and Rizvi, 2020a,b; He et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Narayan et al., 2020a,b; Mishra et al., 2020; Phan and Narayan, 2020; Prabheesh et al., 2020; Salisu and Akanni, 2020; Salisu et al., 2020a,b; Salisu and Sikiru, 2020; Salisu and Vo, 2020; Sharma, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Sikiru and Salisu, 2021; among others)1 and the evidence suggests a negative impact; consequently, the need to hedge against the risk associated with the pandemic becomes crucial.2 This is the motivation for our study. In response to this challenge, we consider gold to be a potential asset that can serve as a good hedge for stocks against the pandemic risk. The pioneering studies on the gold-stocks nexus (see for instance, McDonald and Solnik, 1977; Sherman, 1982; Jaffe, 1989; Chua et al., 1990) indeed support the inclusion of gold in the equities portfolio for the benefits of portfolio diversification and downside risk management.3,4 This continues to be emphasised in the recent literature with pieces of evidence of negative or low correlation of gold in the investment portfolio containing stocks (see for example, Joy, 2011; Reboredo, 2013; Beckmann et al., 2015; Bredin et al., 2015). This strand of the literature also finds support in the conceptual arguments, which suggest stock market hedging qualities of gold when its return is shown to be negative or uncorrelated with the stocks prices (or returns) (see Baur and Lucey, 2010; Baur and McDermott, 2010; Zagaglia and Marzo, 2013).5 In the class of traditional hedging assets, Shahzad et al. (2020), while not particularly considering the COVID-19 pandemic, have shown that gold offers more effective hedging benefits for G7 stock indices.\n"

                    "This paper aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail real estate and high street landscape through acceleration of e-commerce and digitalization. The retail business have been evolving over the past several decades, accentuated by the evolution and development of digital technologies. Almost all parts of the world have witnessed the changes in consumer behavior, the nature of retail, and reshaping of the high street landscape due to the e-commerce revolution and continued expansion. Especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail platforms powered by digital technology had to be adapted quickly, and it is expected to continue to support this change as consumers and retailers adjust to new normalities. Moreover, retail real estate is intricately linked with the retail sector dynamics. While lockdown and social distance rules have devastating impacts on “traditional” retail property sector, it may accelerate the evolution process of multi-channel retail and the channel integration role of physical stores and thus, bring in transformations in urban-retail landscape. It is not necessarily leading to an end of high street stores, but it may have a significant impact on retail real estate business. There remains a lack of understanding of how these changes may pan out with a rigorous academic investigation. To close this knowledge gap, we analyze both the strategy event data of a range of UK retailers as well as the insights from interviews with retail asset manager and landlords using a mixed-method approach. The findings indicate an urgent need for physical shops to reposition the functions of their multi-channel business. Our analysis provide significant insights and highlight several implications for retailers, landlords and, also policy-making units dealing with urban regeneration and local economic development in the post-COVID-19 world.\n" +

                            "Arguably, two concurrent mega-trends with profound economic and social implications that we are experiencing are digitalization and urbanization fuelled by population growth. Retail real estate is right in the middle of these two megatrends. Basic economic needs of a vast population are continuously fuelling the emergence of technological innovations to cater to those needs. As a result, the traditional way of retailing has been going through massive transformations over the last couple of decades to address continuous disruptions. The recent COVID-19 pandemic experience has instigated even much sharper and sudden disruptions. It is not quite possible to see how exactly all these will pan out in future, and what shapes and formats of retail business will sustain coming out the COVID-19 crisis. Nonetheless, we undertake both primary and secondary research to highlight some issues and trends that can facilitate in understanding disruptions and the transformations that are starting to take shape.\n"

These changes are proving to be a catalyst for technology and innovation. In this paper, we discuss the pandemic’s potential impact on the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in various broad sectors, namely healthcare, smart homes, smart buildings, smart cities, transportation and industrial IoT. Our perspective and forecast of this impact on IoT adoption is based on a thorough research literature review, a careful examination of reports from leading consulting firms and interactions with several industry experts. For each of these sectors, we also provide the details of notable IoT initiatives taken in the wake of COVID-19. We also highlight the challenges that need to be addressed and important research directions that will facilitate accelerated IoT adoption.\n" +

                            "The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned as a network of billions of devices that can sense, communicate and share data which can then be analyzed to unlock a wealth of intelligence useful for planning, management and decision making [1]. IoT promises huge benefits for a variety of domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, telecommunication and transportation. Despite the popularity of the IoT concept and its promised benefits, its adoption has been significantly slower than expected [2,3]. Some of the major reasons behind this include: (1) security, privacy, policy and trust issues [3–۵]; (۲) organisational inertia, long capital cycles and shortage of specialist workforce needed to successfully implement IoT [2,5]; and (3) lack of convincing use cases with clear return on investment (ROI) in some sectors.\n" +
                            "COVID-19 has impacted all walks of life so much that we may never return to the old normal. This pandemic is proving to be a catalyst for digital transformation because COVID19 has created or expanded applications and use cases of digital technologies [6–۸]. It has also forced governments, organisations and individuals to change/adapt their priorities, their views on societal/ethical issues, and the way they operate. In many cases, this has addressed or mitigated many of the above mentioned reasons behind the slower-thanexpected adoption of IoT across many verticals. For example, governments have invested huge amounts of resources in IoT and other technologies to combat COVID-19. Lifestyle changes brought about by COVID-19 such as work/study from home have also provided new use cases of IoT with clear ROI such as remote asset control, workforce tracking and remote employee collaboration [9]. Consequently, many organisations have increased investment in IoT and the pace of their IoT projects [10,11]. The fight against COVID-19 has resulted in a less strict stance on privacy issues, higher trust in technology and fasttracked approval procedures. This is also paving the way for accelerated adoption of IoT in various verticals. Furthermore, regulatory changes such as stricter cleaning and tracking requirements for businesses are also accelerating the IoT adoption in smart buildings.\n"

                            "COVID-19 has become what may be the most troubling and complex pandemic that humanity has endured. The pandemic has dramatically impacted prevailing social and economic systems and practices, and triggered profound human health, development and socio-psychological impacts on individuals, families, social groups, enterprises and nations around the world (Alcántara-Ayala et al., 2021; Acuto, 2020; Nathan et al., 2020; Schipper et al., 2020; Wells et al., 2020). We have already grown accustomed to hearing that we live in a “new normality”, though in fact there is no such thing as normality in the present situation, but rather a transition towards reconfigured social and human-environment interactions. These changes and associated uncertainties have global ramifications, with significant impacts and implications for coastal cities and settlements, including how to manage coastal and marine activities. This Special Issue explores the impacts and coastal management implications of COVID-19, including beach management, tourism, fisheries, shipping, and other coastal activities impacted by the pandemic.\n" +
                            "The COVID pandemic brings to the fore the complex interconnections between human and social-ecological system health and coastal governance in an age of climate and global change. Responding to the pandemic and planning for sustainable coastal development needs to account for this complexity and the associated uncertainties that shape policy provisions and processes (e.g., Walker et al., 2003). These uncertainties take different forms: 1) Technical and methodological uncertainty: For example, the statistical and methodological uncertainties inherent in modelling Sars-Cov-2 aerial transmission on beaches and the determination of a safe distance between beach users; 2) Epistemological uncertainty: For example, limited data and knowledge for prioritizing one set of management actions above others, such as whether or not to (re)open, partially or not, beaches or should take advantage of this moment to promote environmental recovery of these systems?; and 3) Ontological uncertainty (indeterminacy): For example, our lack of understanding about coastal dynamics and the multitude of ways in which people interact with and within coastal social-ecological systems and consequent implications for decision-making in the face of indeterminacy, especially in the long term (e.g.,Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1993; Kovacic, 2015; Bombana et al., 2021). In the face of such uncertainties and complexity, this Special Issue shines a light on a critical question for coastal managers and governors: What are the key coastal governance challenges in this age of COVID-19?\n"

                    "A zoonotic coronavirus, tentatively labeled as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERSCoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.\n" +

                            "Of the first 41 cases of laboratory confirmed infections with 2019-nCoV, all had viral pneumonia and almost a third of the patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care and 6 patients (14.6%) died [6]. Since the fatality rate of the early reported case is often high due to bias towards more severe cases, the true mortality risk might be much lower. As of Jan 27, 2020, about 3000 cases have been confirmed in China, and cases were also reported in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, the United States, and Australia, all of which were exported from China. The total number of deaths from the pneumonia-related disease accounts for less than 3%. In addition, most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems. Although the fatality rate will continue to change until all infected people recover, it appears that 2019-nCoV is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV (~10%), and much less than MERS-CoV (~40%).\n" +
                            "Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause a significant percentage of all common colds in human adults and children. Four human coronavirus including 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 are prevalent and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. SARS-CoV which causes SARS, has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections. 2019-nCoV is classified as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of Coronaviridae family. The genome sequence of 2019-nCoV is about 89% identical to bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% identical to human SARS-CoV [7]. It has been reported that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, to infect humans, as SARS-CoV [8], so clinical similarity between the two viruses could be expected, particularly in severe cases. Notably, there are signs, from what is still very limited data, that the clinical features of 2019-nCoV seem to be more variable.\n"
